# Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a machine learning paradigm where agents learn optimal behavior through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties to maximize cumulative rewards over time. Unlike supervised learning, RL focuses on sequential decision-making in dynamic environments.

## üìñ Overview

Reinforcement Learning operates through the **agent-environment loop**:

- **Agent**: Decision-making entity that selects actions
- **Environment**: External system the agent interacts with
- **Actions**: Choices available to the agent
- **Rewards**: Feedback signals guiding learning
- **State**: Current situation representation
- **Policy**: Strategy mapping states to actions

Key algorithms include:

- **Q-Learning**: Value-based learning for discrete action spaces
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Direct policy optimization
- **Actor-Critic**: Combining value and policy approaches
- **Deep RL**: Using neural networks for complex state/action spaces

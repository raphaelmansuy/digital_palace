# üîÑ MLOps (Machine Learning Operations)

**MLOps** combines machine learning, DevOps, and data engineering to standardize and streamline ML model deployment, monitoring, and lifecycle management in production environments.

## üéØ Core Concepts

### **Model Lifecycle Management**
- **Model Versioning**: Track model versions, experiments, and metadata
- **Model Registry**: Centralized repository for model artifacts and metadata
- **Model Lineage**: Track data, code, and model dependencies
- **Automated Retraining**: Trigger model updates based on performance metrics

### **CI/CD for Machine Learning**
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing for ML code and models
- **Continuous Deployment**: Automated model deployment pipelines
- **Model Validation**: Automated testing of model performance and quality
- **A/B Testing**: Compare model versions in production

### **Monitoring & Observability**
- **Model Performance Monitoring**: Track accuracy, latency, throughput
- **Data Drift Detection**: Monitor changes in input data distribution
- **Model Drift Detection**: Track degradation in model performance
- **Feature Store Management**: Centralized feature engineering and serving

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Patterns

### **Basic MLOps Workflow**
```python
# Example MLflow experiment tracking
import mlflow
import mlflow.sklearn
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Start MLflow run
with mlflow.start_run():
    # Train model
    model = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
    model.fit(X_train, y_train)
    
    # Log parameters and metrics
    mlflow.log_param("n_estimators", 100)
    mlflow.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
    
    # Log model
    mlflow.sklearn.log_model(model, "random_forest_model")
```

### **Model Deployment Pipeline**
```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions for model deployment
name: Model Deployment
on:
  push:
    paths: ['models/**']

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy Model
        run: |
          # Model validation
          python validate_model.py
          # Deploy to staging
          python deploy_model.py --env staging
          # Run integration tests
          python test_model_api.py
```

### **Feature Store Implementation**
```python
# Example Feast feature store usage
from feast import FeatureStore

fs = FeatureStore(repo_path="feature_repo/")

# Get features for training
training_df = fs.get_historical_features(
    entity_df=entity_df,
    features=[
        "user_features:age",
        "user_features:income",
        "product_features:category"
    ]
).to_df()

# Get features for inference
features = fs.get_online_features(
    features=feature_list,
    entity_rows=[{"user_id": 123}]
).to_dict()
```

## üìä Best Practices

### **Model Development**
- Version control for data, code, and models
- Reproducible experiments with fixed seeds and dependencies
- Automated model validation and testing
- Clear model documentation and metadata

### **Production Deployment**
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Canary releases for gradual rollouts
- Automated rollback mechanisms
- Health checks and monitoring

### **Monitoring & Maintenance**
- Set up alerts for model performance degradation
- Monitor data quality and feature distributions
- Implement automated retraining pipelines
- Regular model audits and reviews

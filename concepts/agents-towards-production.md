# Agents Towards Production

**Agents Towards Production** is an open-source playbook and tutorial-first resource for building GenAI agents that scale from prototype to production. Curated by Nir Diamant, it provides practical, runnable guides for every layer of the agent stack: orchestration, memory, observability, deployment, security, and more.

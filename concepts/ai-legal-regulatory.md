# AI Legal & Regulatory Compliance

AI Legal & Regulatory Compliance encompasses the legal frameworks, regulations, and compliance requirements governing AI development, deployment, and use. This includes understanding and adhering to the EU AI Act, GDPR, sector-specific regulations, and emerging AI governance standards.

## üèõÔ∏è **Key Regulatory Frameworks**

### **EU AI Act (2024)**
The world's first comprehensive AI regulation, establishing risk-based categories:
- **Unacceptable Risk:** Prohibited AI systems (social scoring, real-time biometric identification)
- **High Risk:** Regulated systems (critical infrastructure, employment, education, healthcare)
- **Limited Risk:** Transparency obligations (chatbots, deepfakes)
- **Minimal Risk:** No specific obligations but encouraged best practices

### **GDPR & Data Protection**
General Data Protection Regulation requirements for AI systems:
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect necessary data
- **Purpose Limitation:** Use data only for specified purposes
- **Right to Explanation:** Automated decision-making transparency
- **Data Subject Rights:** Access, rectification, erasure, portability

### **Sector-Specific Regulations**
- **Healthcare:** HIPAA, FDA AI/ML guidance, Medical Device Regulation (MDR)
- **Finance:** Basel III, MiFID II, Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)
- **Automotive:** ISO 26262, UN-ECE regulations for automated vehicles
- **Aviation:** EASA AI roadmap, FAA guidance on AI/ML

## üìã **Compliance Requirements**

### **Documentation & Record-Keeping**
- **Model Cards:** Document model purpose, performance, limitations
- **Data Lineage:** Track data sources, processing, and transformations
- **Risk Assessments:** Regular evaluation of AI system risks
- **Audit Trails:** Comprehensive logging of decisions and changes

### **Technical Requirements**
- **Explainability:** Provide reasoning for AI decisions
- **Bias Testing:** Regular assessment and mitigation of algorithmic bias
- **Robustness:** Testing against adversarial inputs and edge cases
- **Human Oversight:** Meaningful human review of high-risk decisions

### **Organizational Measures**

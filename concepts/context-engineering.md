# Context Engineering for Agents

Context engineering is the art and science of managing what information is included in the context window of large language models (LLMs) and AI agents at each step of their operation. As LLMs become more capable and agents more autonomous, effective context engineering is essential for performance, cost, and reliability.

---

## üß† Why Context Engineering Matters

- LLMs have limited context windows (like RAM for a CPU)
- Agents must decide what information to include, persist, or retrieve at each step
- Poor context management leads to degraded performance, hallucinations, or excessive costs

---

## üö¶ Core Strategies

### 1. Write Context
- Persist information outside the context window (e.g., scratchpads, memory systems)
- Enables agents to remember plans, facts, or feedback across steps or sessions

### 2. Select Context
- Retrieve and inject only the most relevant information into the context window
- Uses embeddings, knowledge graphs, or heuristics for selection

### 3. Compress Context
- Summarize or trim context to fit within window limits
- Techniques include LLM-based summarization, pruning, or hierarchical compression

### 4. Isolate Context
- Split context across sub-agents or environments
- Reduces token usage and enables parallelism or specialization

## ‚ö° Practical Patterns & Pitfalls

### ‚úÖ Best Practices

- **Use scratchpads and memory** for long tasks and cross-session persistence
- **Apply RAG and semantic search** for relevant retrieval from large knowledge bases
- **Implement hierarchical summarization** for long-running agent trajectories
- **Use state objects** to isolate context and provide fine-grained control
- **Apply tool selection via RAG** when working with large tool collections (3x accuracy improvement)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls

- **Context Poisoning**: When hallucinations contaminate the context window
- **Context Distraction**: When excessive context overwhelms the model's training
- **Context Confusion**: When superfluous information influences responses inappropriately
- **Context Clash**: When different parts of the context contradict each other
- **Memory Selection Issues**: Unwanted or irrelevant memories being retrieved automatically

## üéØ Why "Context Engineering" vs "Prompt Engineering"

The shift from "prompt engineering" to "context engineering" reflects the evolution of the field:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Associated with simple task descriptions for day-to-day LLM use
- **Context Engineering**: Captures the industrial-strength complexity of managing context windows
- **Scope**: Context engineering encompasses prompts, memories, few-shot examples, RAG, multimodal data, tools, state, and history management
- **Complexity**: Requires both science (systematic approaches) and art (intuitive understanding of LLM psychology)

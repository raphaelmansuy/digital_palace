## Overview

A modern, fully open-source textbook that explores why and how deep neural networks learn compact, information-dense representations of high-dimensional real-world data. The book aims to "open the black box" of deep learning models, focusing on interpretability, reliability, and control through the lens of representation learning.

- Covers design principles of neural network architectures via optimization and information theory
- Reduces architecture development to linear algebra and calculus once principles are introduced
- Discusses efficient, interpretable, and controllable models
- Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students with a background in linear algebra, probability, and machine learning

## Why It Matters

This book provides a principled, mathematical perspective on deep learning, bridging theory and practice. It is ideal for those seeking a deeper understanding of how and why modern neural networks work, and how to design models that are both powerful and interpretable.

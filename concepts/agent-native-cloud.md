#### The Cloud Built for AI Agents

- **Purpose**: Agent-native cloud platform for deploying, running, and scaling autonomous agents
- **Best for**: Production agent deployment, multi-framework support, agent-to-agent communication
- **Key Features**:
  - **Framework Agnostic**: Supports CrewAI, LangChain, LlamaIndex, Mastra, Pydantic AI, Vercel AI SDK
  - **Agent-to-Agent Communication**: Seamless handoffs between agents built with different frameworks
  - **Single Command Deployment**: `agentuity deploy` for instant production deployment
  - **Built-in Infrastructure**: No IAM, security groups, or load balancers to configure
  - **Unified AI Gateway**: Connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Perplexity, DeepSeek without managing API keys
  - **Real-time Monitoring**: Performance, memory, cost analytics and debugging
  - **Multi-Channel Integration**: Chat, webhooks, email, SMS, voice, custom interfaces
  - **Development Tools**: CLI, web interface, local dev mode, pre-built agent library

- **Architecture Benefits**:
  - Long-running agent sessions (up to 8 hours with checkpointing)
  - Agent isolation and security boundaries
  - Cross-framework agent collaboration
  - Automatic scaling based on demand
  - Agent-native storage (KV, Vector) and services

- **Pricing**:
  - **Personal**: Free tier with $5 credits
  - **Team**: $10/seat/month + usage costs
  - **Usage**: Agent Compute Units (ACU) based pricing - $0.02/month for typical agent

- **Getting Started**:

  ```bash
  # Install CLI
  curl -fsS https://agentuity.sh | sh
  
  # Create account and login
  agentuity auth signup
  agentuity login
  
  # Create and deploy agent
  agentuity create
  agentuity dev    # Test locally
  agentuity deploy # Deploy to production
  ```

## üß† Agent-Native vs Traditional Cloud

### Agent-Native Advantages

**Built for Agent Workflows**:

- Long-running sessions with state persistence
- Agent-to-agent communication protocols
- Dynamic tool authentication and integration
- Conversation history and memory management

**Simplified Operations**:

- No infrastructure configuration required
- Automatic scaling for agent workloads
- Built-in monitoring for agent-specific metrics
- Framework-agnostic deployment

**Developer Experience**:

- Single command deployment
- Local development with cloud parity
- Pre-built agent templates
- Integrated debugging and observability

### Traditional Cloud Considerations

**When to Use Traditional Cloud**:

- Existing infrastructure investments
- Custom infrastructure requirements
- Specific compliance needs
- Enterprise-scale with dedicated DevOps

**Challenges with Agents**:

- Complex infrastructure setup
- Session state management
- Cross-service communication
- Agent-specific monitoring needs

## üîÑ Integration Patterns

### Multi-Framework Orchestration

```typescript
// Agentuity agent handoff example
export default async function RouterAgent(
  req: AgentRequest,
  resp: AgentResponse,
  ctx: AgentContext
) {
  const userIntent = await analyzeIntent(req.data);
  
  // Route to appropriate agent regardless of framework
  if (userIntent.type === 'code_analysis') {
    return await resp.handoff(
      { name: 'CodeAgent' }, // Built with LangChain
      { data: req.data }
    );
  } else if (userIntent.type === 'data_research') {
    return await resp.handoff(
      { name: 'ResearchAgent' }, // Built with CrewAI
      { data: req.data }
    );
  }
  
  return resp.text("I'll handle this myself!");
}
```

### Channel Integration

```python
# Multi-channel agent deployment
class UniversalAgent:
    async def handle_webhook(self, data):
        """Handle webhook requests"""
        return await self.process(data)
    
    async def handle_email(self, email):
        """Handle email requests"""
        return await self.process(email.content)
    
    async def handle_chat(self, message):
        """Handle chat requests"""
        return await self.process(message)
```

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Platform Selection

**Choose Agent-Native When**:

- Rapid prototyping to production
- Multi-framework agent systems
- Focus on agent logic vs infrastructure
- Need agent-to-agent communication
- Small to medium team size

**Choose Traditional Cloud When**:

- Existing cloud infrastructure
- Custom infrastructure requirements
- Enterprise compliance needs
- Large-scale, complex deployments
- Dedicated DevOps resources

### Deployment Strategy

1. **Start with Agent-Native**: Rapid prototyping and validation

## Overview

A hands-on tutorial for building a fully local, production-ready multi-agent home renovation planner using Google ADK and Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana). The system analyzes room photos, understands style preferences, generates photorealistic renovation renderings, and provides budget/timeline recommendationsâ€”all orchestrated by a multi-agent pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Smart Image Analysis:** Upload room and inspiration photos for automatic analysis using Gemini's vision capabilities.
- **Photorealistic Rendering:** Generate high-quality images of renovated spaces with Nano Banana.
- **Budget-Aware Planning:** Get recommendations that respect your financial constraints.
- **Complete Roadmap:** Timeline estimation, budget breakdown, contractor lists, and actionable checklists.
- **Iterative Refinement:** Edit generated renderings with natural language instructions.
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Demonstrates Coordinator/Dispatcher and Sequential Pipeline patterns.
- **Versioned Artifacts:** Automatic version tracking for all generated renderings.

## How It Works

1. **User uploads photos or describes needs.**
2. **Coordinator agent** routes requests to specialist agents (visual assessment, design planning, project coordination).
3. **VisualAssessor** analyzes images and provides detailed assessment.
4. **DesignPlanner** creates actionable design recommendations.
5. **ProjectCoordinator** generates renderings, budget, and timeline.
6. **RenderingEditor** allows iterative edits to generated images.

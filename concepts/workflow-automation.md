        """Trigger workflow based on incoming event"""
        workflow_id = self.determine_workflow(event)
        
        if workflow_id:
            process_instance = WorkflowInstance(
                workflow_id=workflow_id,
                trigger_event=event,
                created_at=datetime.now()
            )
            
            await self.execute_workflow(process_instance)
    
    async def execute_workflow(self, instance: 'WorkflowInstance'):
        """Execute workflow steps with AI decision points"""
        current_step = instance.get_current_step()
        
        while current_step:
            # AI-powered decision making
            decision = await self.ai_decision_engine.decide(
                step=current_step,
                context=instance.context
            )
            
            # Execute step based on AI decision
            result = await self.execute_step(current_step, decision)
            
            # Update instance state
            instance.update_state(current_step, result)
            
            # Get next step
            current_step = instance.get_next_step(result)
    
    async def execute_step(self, step, decision):
        """Execute individual workflow step"""
        if step.type == "api_call":
            return await self.make_api_call(step, decision)
        elif step.type == "data_processing":
            return await self.process_data(step, decision)
        elif step.type == "human_task":
            return await self.create_human_task(step, decision)
        # Add more step types as needed
```

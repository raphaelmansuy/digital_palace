# Motia: Unified Backend Framework for APIs, Jobs & AI Agents


Motia is a modern, open-source backend framework that unifies APIs, background jobs, scheduled tasks, and AI agents into a single, event-driven system. It supports TypeScript, Python, and more, enabling polyglot workflows with shared state, observability, and real-time streaming.


## Key Features

- **Unified Steps:** APIs, jobs, and agents are all "Steps"—modular units of logic that can be written in different languages and connected via events.
- **Polyglot:** Write Steps in TypeScript, Python, JavaScript, Ruby (beta), Go/Rust (coming soon).
- **Event-Driven:** Steps communicate by emitting and subscribing to events, enabling complex workflows and automation.
- **State Management:** All Steps share a unified key-value state store, automatically traced for full data lifecycle visibility.
- **Observability:** Built-in tracing, logging, and workflow visualization via the Motia Workbench UI.
- **Real-Time Streaming:** Push live updates from workflows to clients using Streams—ideal for dashboards and interactive agents.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Automatic retries and error handling for robust, resilient workflows.
- **Cloud & Local:** Deploy to Motia Cloud, self-host, or run locally. Roadmap includes support for AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and more.
- **Open Source:** MIT licensed, active roadmap, and welcoming community.

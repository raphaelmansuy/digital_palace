**Source:** [AI Engineer Book Resources by Chip Huyen](https://github.com/chiphuyen/aie-book/blob/main/resources.md)

A comprehensive, expertly curated collection of foundational and advanced resources for AI engineering, compiled by Chip Huyen. This living document organizes 100s of high-quality links—papers, blog posts, guides, tools, and case studies—across the full AI engineering stack. It is designed to help practitioners, researchers, and learners navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, LLMs, and agentic systems.

## Structure & Highlights

- **ML Theory Fundamentals:**
  - Stanford CS231n, Karpathy's Zero to Hero, Murphy's Probabilistic ML, math primers, and more.
- **Planning Applications with Foundation Models:**
  - Research on LLM impact, applied LLMs, product deployment case studies, design guidelines, and state-of-AI reports.
- **Understanding Foundation Models:**
  - Key papers on GPT, Gopher, Llama, Chinchilla, Qwen, scaling laws, infrastructure, and interpretability.
  - Fun/quirky resources: GPT2 in Excel, BertViz, feature steering, monosemanticity.
- **Evaluation Methodology:**
  - Benchmarks, evaluation frameworks, leaderboard design, hallucination surveys, and model behavior studies.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Interactive tutorials, prompt libraries, guides from Anthropic, Meta, Google, OpenAI, and more.
  - Defensive prompt engineering: adversarial attacks, security, jailbreaking, and mitigation tools.
- **RAG & Agents:**
  - RAG pattern, chunking, vector search, real-time data, agent benchmarks, tool use, and agentic architectures.
- **Finetuning:**
  - Best practices, LoRA/QLoRA/PEFT, parameter-efficient methods, synthetic data, and alignment.
- **Dataset Engineering:**
  - Public dataset repositories, annotation best practices, deduplication, synthetic data, and evaluation harnesses.
- **Inference Optimization:**
  - Inference acceleration, cache optimization, hardware, datacenter scaling, and energy efficiency.
- **AI Engineering Architecture & User Feedback:**
  - Monitoring, human-AI interaction, feedback protocols, and user-centric design.
- **Bonus: Organization Engineering Blogs:**
  - LinkedIn, DoorDash, Uber, Google, Pinterest, Netflix, LMSYS, Anyscale, Databricks, Together, Duolingo, and more.

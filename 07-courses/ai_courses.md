## AWS Generative AI DeepDive Study

Generative AI Foundations on AWS is a technical deep dive course that gives you the conceptual fundamentals, practical advice, and hands-on guidance to pre-train, fine-tune, and deploy state-of-the-art foundation models on AWS and beyond. Developed by AWS Generative AI Worldwide Foundations Lead Emily Webber, this free hands-on course and the supporting GitHub source code. If you are looking for a curated playlist of the top resources, concepts, and guidance to get up to speed on foundation models, and especially those that unlock generative capabilities in your data science and machine learning projects, then look no further.

During this 8-hour deep dive, you will be introduced to the key techniques, services, and trends that will help you understand foundation models from the ground up. This means breaking down theory, mathematics, and abstract concepts combined with hands-on exercises to gain functional intuition for practical application. Throughout the course, we focus on a wide spectrum of progressively complex generative AI techniques, giving you a strong base to understand, design, and apply your own models for the best performance. We’ll start with recapping foundation models, understanding where they come from, how they work, how they relate to generative AI, and what you can to do customize them. You’ll then learn about picking the right foundation model to suit your use case.

Once you’ve developed a strong contextual understanding of foundation models and how to use them, you’ll be introduced to the core subject of this course: pre-training new foundation models. You’ll learn why you’d want to do this as well as how and where it’s competitive. You’ll even learn how to use the scaling laws to pick the right model, dataset, and compute sizes. We’ll cover preparing training datasets at scale on AWS, including picking the right instances and storage techniques. We’ll cover fine-tuning your foundation models, evaluating recent techniques, and understanding how to run these with your scripts and models. We’ll dive into reinforcement learning with human feedback, exploring how to use it skillfully and at scale to truly maximize your foundation model performance.

Finally, you’ll learn how to apply theory to production by deploying your new foundation model on Amazon SageMaker, including across multiple GPUs and using top design patterns like retrieval augmented generation and chained dialogue. As an added bonus, we’ll walk you through a Stable Diffusion deep dive, prompt engineering best practices, standing up LangChain, and more.

# AI orchestration with LLamaIndex and LangChain

Are you ready to dive into the world of AI applications? This course was designed for you. AI orchestration frameworks let you step back from the details of artificial intelligence tools and APIs and instead focus on building more general, effective systems that solve real-world problems. Join instructor M.Joel Dubinko as he explores the business benefits of AI orchestration—faster development, smarter interfaces, lower costs, and more. This course provides an overview of AI fundamentals and key capabilities, like accessing external tools and databases, with a special focus on exploring local models running on your own hardware, alongside or instead of cloud services like those from OpenAI. Every step of the way, Joel offers hands-on demonstrations of two industry-leading frameworks: LangChain and LlamaIndex. By the end of this course, you’ll be prepared to start building chatbots, intelligent agents, and other useful tools, while monitoring for errors and troubleshooting as you go.

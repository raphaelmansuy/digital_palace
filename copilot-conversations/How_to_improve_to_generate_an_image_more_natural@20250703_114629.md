**user**: How to improve to generate an image more natural
[Timestamp: 2025/07/03 11:46:29]

**ai**: To generate more natural-looking images using AI, you can leverage the following techniques, as highlighted in the provided context:

**1. Utilize Reference Files:**

*   **Example:** Include a real photograph (`IMG_375.jpg` in the example) in your prompt. This helps the AI understand what "genuine" or "natural" looks like. The model will try to mimic the style, lighting, and composition of the reference image.

**2. Provide Explicit Instructions:**

*   **Focus on Natural Elements:**  Specifically ask for "natural lighting," "natural composition," and "imperfections." This steers the AI away from overly polished or artificial-looking results.
*   **Avoid "AI Art" Tropes:**  Explicitly discourage stylistic elements often associated with AI-generated art.

**3. Design Space Prompting:**

*   **Break Down Visual Attributes:** Instead of just describing the scene, prompt the AI to generate variations along specific dimensions like "shape," "color palette," "texture," "composition," and "style." This allows for more controlled and nuanced image generation.

**4. Review and Iterate:**

*   **Critical Evaluation:** Always review the generated images for subtle artifacts or inconsistencies that might indicate an artificial origin.
*   **Iterative Generation:** Use the AI's ability to generate variations along defined dimensions to refine the image until it achieves the desired level of naturalism.

**In essence, the key is to guide the AI with concrete examples and instructions that emphasize realism and avoid artificial stylistic elements. By using reference images and specifying naturalistic details, you can significantly improve the natural appearance of AI-generated images.**

**ai**: To generate more natural images using AI, you can leverage a technique called **reference file prompting**. This involves providing a real photo (`IMG_375.jpg` in the example) as a style guide. 

Here's how it works, based on the provided context:

*   **Reference File:** Using a real photo helps the model understand what "genuine" looks like.
*   **Explicit Instructions:** Include instructions for natural lighting, composition, and imperfections to steer the model away from artificial-looking results.

The document also highlights that the fundamental approach of prompting AI to surface relevant dimensions and mapping responses into those dimensions is domain-agnostic. This means the technique can be applied to various creative fields like logo design, architectural drafting, and fashion sketching. You can guide the AI to explore dimensions such as shape, color palette, texture, composition, and style.

For finding people in generated images, the provided text doesn't offer specific prompting techniques. However, the core principle of providing detailed instructions within the prompt would apply. You could try including descriptive terms like "a group of people at a party," "people interacting," or specifying details about their appearance and actions. 

**Important Tip:** Always review generated images for subtle artifacts or inconsistencies before publishing.

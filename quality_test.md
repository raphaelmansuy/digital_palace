# High Quality Code Test

Testing high-resolution code block rendering:

```python
def high_quality_function():
    """This function should render in high quality."""
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"High DPI line {i}: {'x' * 20}")
    return "Crystal clear text!"
```

This should produce a crisp, 300 DPI image.

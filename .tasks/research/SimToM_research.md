## LinkedIn Post Draft Elements

### Hook (50-75 words)
"89% of business communications fail because they ignore the audience's perspective. What if you could see through your stakeholders' eyes before crafting any message? SimToM (Simulation Theory of Mind) transforms communication by modeling different perspectives—delivering 189% better stakeholder engagement through true empathy."

### Problem Statement (75-100 words)
"Most business communication is self-centered. We explain what we know, not what the audience needs to hear. Executives speak in strategy terms to operational teams. Technical teams overwhelm business stakeholders with details. Sales teams pitch features to customers who care about outcomes. Change managers announce decisions without addressing employee concerns. This perspective blindness leads to confusion, resistance, and failed initiatives. Your message might be perfect for you, but completely wrong for your audience. The result? Wasted time, missed opportunities, and frustrated stakeholders."

### Solution Explanation (100-150 words)
"Simulation Theory of Mind (SimToM) revolutionizes communication through perspective modeling. Before crafting any message, SimToM simulates your audience's viewpoint—their knowledge level, concerns, priorities, and decision-making context. It asks: What does this person already know? What do they need to understand? What concerns them most? What motivates their decisions? This creates truly audience-centric communication. SimToM works across any stakeholder relationship—customers, employees, investors, partners, regulators. It ensures your message resonates with their specific perspective. The system adapts everything—language complexity, focus areas, supporting evidence, emotional tone. SimToM transforms one-size-fits-all communication into personalized, perspective-aware messaging that actually works."

### Implementation Guide (100-125 words)
"**Step 1:** Identify your stakeholder groups and their key characteristics **Step 2:** Map each group's knowledge level, concerns, and priorities **Step 3:** Model their perspective before crafting any message **Step 4:** Adapt content, tone, and focus to match their viewpoint **Step 5:** Test messages with representative stakeholders **Step 6:** Refine perspective models based on feedback **Step 7:** Apply SimToM across all stakeholder communications. Start with your most important stakeholder relationships—key customers, executive team, critical employees. The key is truly understanding their perspective, not just demographics. Focus on what they know, what they care about, and how they make decisions."

### Call to Action (25-50 words)
"How well do you understand your stakeholders' perspectives? Share your biggest challenge with stakeholder communication. What percentage of your messages miss the mark because of perspective blindness?"

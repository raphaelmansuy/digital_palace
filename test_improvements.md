# Test Document with Horizontal Rules

This document tests both improvements.

---

## First Section

Here's some code:

```python
def test_function():
    print("This will be saved as persistent image")
    return "First code block"
```

---

## Second Section  

Another code block:

```bash
echo "This should be image002"
ls -la *.png
pwd
```

---

## Third Section

One more test:

```javascript
function testJS() {
    console.log("JavaScript code block");
    return { image: "003" };
}
```

---

The horizontal rules above should be visible lines, and the images should be saved alongside the DOCX file.

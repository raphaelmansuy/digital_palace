# Building a Multi-Agent Learning System with LlamaIndex and Mem0

This guide provides a summary and link to a tutorial on building a multi-agent learning system using LlamaIndex for orchestration and Mem0 for persistent, shared memory.

## Overview

The tutorial demonstrates a personal learning system with two collaborating agents:

- **TutorAgent**: The primary instructor for teaching concepts.
- **PracticeAgent**: Generates exercises and tracks the student's learning progress.

A key feature of this system is the shared memory context, which allows both agents to learn from student interactions, creating a continuous and personalized learning experience.

## Key Concepts

- **Persistent Memory**: Agents remember interactions across different sessions.
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents can delegate tasks to each other.
- **Personalized Learning**: The system adapts to individual learning styles.
- **Memory-Driven Teaching**: The agents reference past successes and struggles to inform their teaching strategy.

## Implementation

The implementation uses `LlamaIndex AgentWorkflow` for managing the agents and `Mem0Memory` for the memory component. The code defines the agents, their tools, and the workflow that orchestrates their collaboration.

# Unlocking AI Agent Collaboration: Converting ADK Agents for A2A

> **External Guide** | [Read the full article on Google Cloud Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/unlock-ai-agent-collaboration-convert-adk-agents-for-a2a/?hl=en)

## Overview

This guide from Google Cloud details how to convert standalone Google ADK (Agent Development Kit) agents—using the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—into fully interoperable components using the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) framework. The A2A protocol enables agents to discover, communicate, and collaborate securely, unlocking the potential for robust multi-agent systems.


**Key Steps Covered:**

- Defining the core agent and its MCP tool
- Establishing a public identity for agent discovery
- Implementing the A2A task manager for orchestration
- Creating the agent's invoke method for task execution
- Building orchestrator agents that discover and delegate to other agents


**Why it matters:**

- Enables agent interoperability and collaboration
- Supports scalable, production-ready multi-agent architectures
- Provides code samples and links to open-source resources

## üé¨ Fundamentals of Cinematic Prompting

### Visual Storytelling

- **Composition**: Use established film grammar (wide, medium, close-up)
- **Movement**: Specify camera movements that serve the story
- **Lighting**: Describe mood through lighting quality and direction
- **Color**: Use color psychology to enhance emotional impact

### Shot Types & When to Use Them

| Shot Type | Purpose | Example Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)** | Establish location, show scale | Opening scenes, landscapes |
| **Wide Shot (WS)** | Show full subject and environment | Character introductions |
| **Medium Wide Shot (MWS)** | Show subject from knees up | Conversations, interactions |
| **Medium Shot (MS)** | Show subject from waist up | Standard dialogue shots |
| **Medium Close-Up (MCU)** | Show subject from chest up | Emotional moments |
| **Close-Up (CU)** | Show face or important detail | Reactions, emotions |
| **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)** | Show specific detail | Eyes, hands, objects |

### Camera Movements & Their Impact

- **Static Shot**: Creates stability, focus, contemplation
- **Pan**: Reveals information, follows action horizontally
- **Tilt**: Shows scale, reveals vertical information
- **Dolly In/Out**: Creates intimacy or distance
- **Tracking Shot**: Follows subject, creates dynamism
- **Crane/Boom**: Shows grandeur, god's eye view
- **Handheld**: Adds realism, energy, or unease

### Technical Specifications

## üé® Advanced Lighting Techniques

### Three-Point Lighting Setup
- **Key Light**: Primary light source (45¬∞ angle from subject)
- **Fill Light**: Softens shadows (opposite side, lower intensity)
- **Back Light**: Separates subject from background

### Mood Through Lighting
- **High Key**: Bright, even lighting (comedy, romance)
- **Low Key**: Strong contrasts, deep shadows (thriller, drama)
- **Chiaroscuro**: Dramatic light/dark contrasts (noir, horror)
- **Practical Lighting**: Visible light sources in scene (realism)

## üé≠ Advanced Cinematographic Grammar

### The 180-Degree Rule
- **Principle**: Keep camera on one side of action to maintain spatial relationships
- **Breaking It**: Cross the line for disorientation or dramatic effect
- **AI Prompt**: "maintaining screen direction, consistent eyeline match"

### Continuity and Matching
- **Eyeline Match**: Character looks off-screen, cut to what they see
- **Match Cut**: Visual similarity between two shots (shape, movement, color)
- **Action Match**: Continue movement across cuts
- **AI Prompt**: "seamless action continuity, matching eyeline direction"

### Montage Theory (Eisenstein's Principles)
- **Metric Montage**: Cuts based on shot length rhythm
- **Rhythmic Montage**: Cuts based on movement within frame
- **Tonal Montage**: Cuts based on emotional tone
- **Intellectual Montage**: Cuts create meaning through juxtaposition

### Transition Types
- **Cut**: Instant change (most common)
- **Fade**: Gradual to/from black (time passage, finality)
- **Dissolve**: Overlap between shots (memory, dreams)
- **Wipe**: One image replaces another with visible boundary
- **Match Dissolve**: Morphing between similar compositions

## üéØ Professional Prompt Engineering

### The CAMERA Method
A systematic approach to crafting cinematic prompts:

- **C**omposition: Frame and layout
- **A**ngle: Camera position and perspective
- **M**ovement: Camera and subject motion
- **E**motion: Mood and atmosphere
- **R**eference: Style and aesthetic
- **A**udio: Sound design consideration

### Advanced Prompt Layering
Build prompts in layers for maximum control:

```json
{
  "layer_1_foundation": {
    "shot_type": "establishing the basic frame",
    "subject": "primary focus of the scene"
  },
  "layer_2_cinematography": {
    "lighting": "mood and atmosphere",
    "camera_work": "movement and positioning"
  },
  "layer_3_style": {
    "visual_reference": "aesthetic inspiration",
    "color_palette": "emotional color choices"
  },
  "layer_4_enhancement": {
    "details": "specific nuances",
    "atmosphere": "environmental elements"
  }
}
```

## üîß Advanced Cinematographic Techniques

### Mise-en-sc√®ne Mastery
Everything within the frame contributes to storytelling:

- **Setting**: Location communicates context and mood
- **Lighting**: Creates atmosphere and guides attention
- **Costume/Makeup**: Reveals character and time period
- **Props**: Support narrative and create authenticity
- **Performance**: Actor positioning and movement

**AI Prompt Integration**:
```json
{
  "mise_en_scene": {
    "setting": "specific location with historical/cultural context",
    "lighting_mood": "atmospheric lighting that supports story",
    "visual_details": "props and costume elements",
    "character_staging": "positioning and movement within frame"
  }
}
```

### Diegetic vs Non-Diegetic Elements
Understanding what exists within the story world:

- **Diegetic**: Elements characters can see/hear (practical lights, ambient sound)
- **Non-Diegetic**: Elements only audience perceives (soundtrack, titles)

**AI Prompt Examples**:
- Diegetic: "practical desk lamp illuminating character's face"
- Non-Diegetic: "cinematic lighting that creates dramatic mood"

### Temporal Cinematography
Using time as a narrative element:

- **Real Time**: Events unfold naturally
- **Slow Motion**: Emphasizes critical moments
- **Time Lapse**: Shows change over time
- **Freeze Frame**: Stops action for emphasis

**AI Prompt Structure**:
```json
{
  "temporal_effects": {
    "speed": "[real_time/slow_motion/time_lapse]",
    "duration": "specific timing requirements",
    "narrative_purpose": "why this timing serves the story"
  }
}
```

## üé® Color Science for AI

### Color Temperature Mixing
Advanced color temperature techniques:

- **Warm/Cool Contrast**: Creates depth and visual interest
- **Gradual Shifts**: Subtle temperature changes across frame
- **Practical Sources**: Mixed lighting from multiple sources
- **Time-Based Changes**: Temperature shifts showing time passage

**AI Prompt Examples**:
```json
{
  "color_temperature": {
    "key_light": "3200K tungsten warmth",
    "fill_light": "5600K daylight balance",
    "background": "gradient from warm to cool",
    "practical_sources": "mixed candlelight and window light"
  }
}
```

### Advanced Color Grading Looks
Professional color grading styles:

- **Bleach Bypass**: High contrast, desaturated with retained silver
- **Day-for-Night**: Daytime footage graded to appear nocturnal
- **Teal and Orange**: Popular commercial look
- **Monochromatic**: Single color dominance
- **Split Toning**: Different colors for highlights and shadows

## üé≠ Character-Driven Cinematography

### Psychological Cinematography
Camera techniques that reflect character psychology:

- **Subjective Camera**: Audience sees through character's eyes
- **Objective Camera**: Observational, documentary-style
- **Omniscient Camera**: God's eye view, all-knowing perspective

**AI Prompt Integration**:
```json
{
  "psychological_perspective": {
    "viewpoint": "[subjective/objective/omniscient]",
    "character_state": "emotional or mental condition",
    "camera_behavior": "how camera reflects psychology"
  }
}
```

### Relationship Cinematography
Showing relationships through visual techniques:

- **Proximity**: Physical closeness reflects emotional connection
- **Eye Level**: Power dynamics through height relationships
- **Shared Frame**: Characters in same shot show connection
- **Separation**: Visual isolation reflects emotional distance

Get ready to become a proficient logic and algebra master!

## Syntax of Formulas
Propositional logic uses symbols to represent propositions and logical connectives to combine them. Let's break it down:

- Propositional variables: p, q, r, ...
- Logical connectives:
  - Negation (NOT): ¬
  - Conjunction (AND): ∧
  - Disjunction (OR): ∨
  - Implication (IF-THEN): →
  - Biconditional (IF AND ONLY IF): ↔

Example 1:
- p: "I love coding."
- q: "I have a fast computer."
- Formula: p ∧ q (I love coding AND I have a fast computer.)

Example 2:
- p: "The sun is shining."
- q: "It is a weekend."
- Formula: p → q (IF the sun is shining, THEN it is a weekend.)

## Translating English to Propositional Formulas and Vice Versa
Translating between English sentences and propositional formulas is a crucial skill. Let's practice with more examples!

Example 1:
- English: "If I study hard, then I will pass the exam."
- Propositional formula: p → q, where p: "I study hard," and q: "I will pass the exam."

Example 2:
- English: "I will go to the party, or I will watch a movie at home."
- Propositional formula: p ∨ q, where p: "I will go to the party," and q: "I will watch a movie at home."

Example 3:
- Propositional formula: ¬p ∧ q
- English: "It is not raining, and I have an umbrella."

## Valuations and Truth Tables
Valuations assign truth values to propositional variables, and truth tables show the truth value of a formula for all possible combinations of truth values.

Example:
Formula: (p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q

| p | q | p ∨ q | ¬q | (p ∨ q) ∧ ¬q |
|---|---|-------|----|--------------------|
| T | T |   T   | F  |         F          |
| T | F |   T   | T  |         T          |
| F | T |   T   | F  |         F          |
| F | F |   F   | T  |         F          |

## Satisfiability and Validity
A formula is satisfiable if there exists at least one valuation that makes it true, and valid if it is true under all possible valuations.

Example 1:
- Satisfiable formula: (p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ ¬q)
- Explanation: This formula is true when p and q have the same truth value (both true or both false).

Example 2:
- Valid formula: p ∨ ¬p (Law of Excluded Middle)
- Explanation: This formula is always true, regardless of the truth value of p.

Example 3:
- Unsatisfiable formula: p ∧ ¬p (Contradiction)
- Explanation: This formula is always false, as p cannot be both true and false simultaneously.

## Logical Equivalences
Logical equivalences help simplify and manipulate propositional formulas. Two formulas are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value under all possible valuations.

Example 1:
- De Morgan's Laws:
  - ¬(p ∧ q) ≡ ¬p ∨ ¬q
  - ¬(p ∨ q) ≡ ¬p ∧ ¬q
- Explanation: These laws show how negation distributes over conjunction and disjunction.

Example 2:
- Absorption Laws:
  - p ∧ (p ∨ q) ≡ p
  - p ∨ (p ∧ q) ≡ p
- Explanation: These laws demonstrate how a proposition "absorbs" a conjunction or disjunction containing itself.

## Disjunctive and Conjunctive Normal Forms (DNF/CNF)
DNF and CNF are standardized formats for representing propositional formulas.

Example 1 (DNF):
- Formula: (p ∧ q) ∨ (¬p ∧ r)
- Explanation: This formula is in DNF, as it is a disjunction of conjunctions of literals.

Example 2 (CNF):
- Formula: (p ∨ q) ∧ (¬p ∨ r)
- Explanation: This formula is in CNF, as it is a conjunction of disjunctions of literals.

## Definition of a Boolean Algebra
A Boolean algebra is a set B with two binary operations (∧ and ∨), a unary operation (¬), and two distinguished elements (0 and 1) that satisfy certain axioms.

Example:
- The set of propositions {p, q, r} with the logical connectives {∧, ∨, ¬} forms a Boolean algebra.
- The axioms (commutativity, associativity, distributivity, identity, and complement) hold for this set.

## Sum of Products / Product of Sums
Sum of Products (SOP) and Product of Sums (POS) are two ways to represent Boolean functions.

Example 1 (SOP):
- Boolean function: f(x, y, z) = x'yz + xy'z + xyz
- Explanation: This function is represented as a disjunction (sum) of minterms (products of literals).

Example 2 (POS):
- Boolean function: f(x, y, z) = (x + y + z')(x + y' + z)(x' + y + z)
- Explanation: This function is represented as a conjunction (product) of maxterms (sums of literals).

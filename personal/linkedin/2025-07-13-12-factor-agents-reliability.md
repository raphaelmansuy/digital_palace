ðŸš¨ **Hard truth**: If your AI agent works 80% of the time, it doesn't work at all.

I just watched Dex Horthy (CEO of HumanLayer) drop some serious knowledge at AI Engineer Conference 2025, and it's a game-changer for anyone building production AI systems.

**The Problem We All Face:**
â€¢ You build an agent that works great in demos
â€¢ CEO gets excited, adds 6 more people to the team
â€¢ Then you're 7 layers deep in a call stack trying to figure out why it breaks in production
â€¢ Sound familiar? ðŸ¤•

**Here's what Dex discovered after talking to 100+ founders building agents:**

Most production agents aren't really "agentic" at all - they're just well-engineered software with LLMs sprinkled in the right places.

**The 12-Factor Agents Framework** (inspired by 12-Factor Apps):

ðŸ”§ **Factor 1: Structure Over Magic** - LLMs excel at turning sentences into JSON. That's the real magic, not complex loops.

ðŸŽ¯ **Factor 2: Own Your Prompts** - Every token matters. You'll eventually hand-write every prompt for quality.

âš¡ **Factor 4: Tool Use is Harmful** - Stop thinking of tools as magic. It's just JSON â†’ deterministic code â†’ results.

ðŸ”„ **Factor 8: Own Your Control Flow** - Don't let the LLM decide everything. You control the DAG, the LLM fills the gaps.

ðŸ”„ **Pause/Resume Everything** - Agents are just APIs. Serialize state, handle interruptions, resume seamlessly.

ðŸŽ¯ **Small Focused Agents** - Instead of one mega-agent, build micro-agents with 3-10 steps each.

**Real-world example:** HumanLayer's deployment bot is mostly deterministic CI/CD, but when a GitHub PR merges, an agent decides deployment order based on natural language input from humans.

**The key insight?** Find tasks right at the boundary of what models can do reliably, then engineer reliability into your system.

**Why this matters:**
âœ… 4K+ GitHub stars in 2 months  
âœ… Front page of HackerNews  
âœ… 200K+ social impressions  
âœ… Battle-tested patterns from real production systems

The framework isn't anti-framework - it's a wishlist for better tools that handle the boring stuff so we can focus on the hard AI parts: prompts, flow, and tokens.

**Bottom line:** Agents are software. If you can write a switch statement and a while loop, you can build reliable agents.

ðŸŽ¯ **What's your biggest challenge with AI agents in production?** Drop it in the comments - let's solve this together.

P.S. If you're building agents that need to collaborate with humans, check out HumanLayer's A2 protocol. The future is human-AI collaboration, not replacement.

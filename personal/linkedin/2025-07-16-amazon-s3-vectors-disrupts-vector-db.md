"Vector databases are dead before RAG!" ðŸ˜±ðŸ”¥

AWS just unveiled Amazon S3 Vectors (preview)â€”the FIRST cloud storage with native vector support at massive scale. Users are raving: "Awesome for cost cuts!" and "Desired feature arrived faster than expected!"

**Why it's disrupting everything:**

- **90% Cost Slash:** Store/query billions of embeddings from images, videos, docs affordablyâ€”no more premium DBs.
- **Sub-Second Speed:** Semantic search with ease for RAG, recommendations, and AI agents.
- **Seamless Integrations:** Natively plugs into Bedrock Knowledge Bases, SageMaker, and OpenSearch.

# LinkedIn Post - Why 95% of AI Agents Never Make It to Production (And One GitHub Repo That Changes Everything)

**Date:** July 24, 2025  
**Type:** Resource Spotlight / Industry Insight  
**Target:** AI Engineers, CTOs, Startup Founders, ML Engineers, Product Managers  
**Hook:** The brutal reality of AI agent deployment and the comprehensive playbook that solves it  
**Status:** Draft

🚨 **Reality Check**: 95% of AI agents die in the "demo to production" valley of death.

You've seen it:
• Agent works perfectly in demo ✅
• Founders get excited 📈
• Months later... still "almost ready" 😵

**Why agents fail to scale:**
❌ No observability into decisions  
❌ Security vulnerabilities everywhere  
❌ Memory that forgets context  
❌ Can't integrate with real systems

🎯 **Game-Changer Alert**

Nir Diamant just dropped **"Agents Towards Production"** - the most comprehensive open-source playbook for GenAI agents that actually scale.

🔗 **GitHub: NirDiamant/agents-towards-production** (8.9K+ stars)

**What's different:**
📚 Tutorial-first: Every concept = runnable code  
🛡️ Production security patterns  
🧠 Memory systems that work at scale  
� End-to-end observability  
🚀 Real deployment strategies  

---

**💡 Why This Matters**

The demo is 10% of the work. Production is the other 90%.

This repository tackles every production challenge:
• Agent hallucinations at scale
• Memory architecture for long conversations  
• Debugging agent decisions
• Security patterns that actually work

**With code, not just theory.**

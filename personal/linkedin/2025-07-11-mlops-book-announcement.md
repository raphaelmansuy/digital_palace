**Last week, Packt Publishing approached me about writing a book on MLOps.**

After 5 years of building ML systems at scale, I realized: we need a different kind of MLOps book.

While books like "Practical MLOps" and "Designing Machine Learning Systems" cover deployment excellently, they miss the most expensive part: the operational reality that hits AFTER your model goes live.

At DECATHLON, we've learned this the hard way building ML systems across our global platform serving 400+ million users worldwide.

Working with DECATHLON's incredible AI/ML team, we're writing the book that bridges the gap between "it works in staging" and "it works at scale":

‚ùå Not: "Here's how to deploy a model"
‚úÖ Instead: "Here's how to keep ML systems stable while serving millions of daily requests"

‚ùå Not: "Here's the latest MLOps tools"  
‚úÖ Instead: "Here's why we chose specific tools and what we learned when they failed"

‚ùå Not: "Here's what worked at Big Tech"
‚úÖ Instead: "Here's what works when you have real budget constraints and business pressure"

**üö® REAL DATA ALERT:**
We've just finished Chapter 1: "The Hidden Production Reality" - and I'm sharing the key insights here.

What we discovered building ML systems at global scale:
‚Ä¢ Most ML failures happen in the operational layer, not the model layer
‚Ä¢ The gap between "demo works" and "production works" is where most teams fail
‚Ä¢ Complex ML systems fail in ways that traditional software doesn't
‚Ä¢ Organizational alignment is often more critical than technical architecture

**The brutal truth?**
Your production education starts the moment your model goes live.
Everything before that is just expensive practice.

**I need YOUR war stories:**

üëâ **What's the most expensive production ML failure you've seen?**
üëâ **What warning signs do you wish you'd caught earlier?**
üëâ **What would have saved your team 6 months of pain?**

This isn't just our book - it's the community's field guide to production ML reality.

**Share your story below and I'll send you early access to Chapter 2: "The Drift Detection Playbook"** üî•

## Tutorial: Fine-Tuning Custom LLMs with LoRA

Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is a powerful technique for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) in a parameter-efficient manner. This tutorial, based on insights from extensive experiments, will guide you through the process of applying LoRA to train custom LLMs effectively.

### Introduction to LoRA

LoRA stands for Low-Rank Adaptation, a method that introduces a small number of trainable parameters to a model while keeping the original model parameters frozen. It achieves this by decomposing a weight matrix into two smaller matrices, allowing for efficient fine-tuning.

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Evaluation Tasks and Dataset**

- Focus on supervised instruction-finetuning of LLMs.
- Use a fixed dataset for consistency, such as the Alpaca dataset, which consists of instruction-response pairs.

#### 2. **Code Framework**

- Utilize the Lit-GPT repository for fine-tuning. Clone the repository, install requirements, and prepare your dataset and model checkpoint.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lightning-AI/lit-gpt
cd lit-gpt
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 3. **Choosing a Good Base Model**

- Select a base model that has not been instruction-finetuned. Models like Llama 2 7B can be a good starting point.

#### 4. **Evaluating the LoRA Defaults**

- Begin with default LoRA settings to establish a baseline. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and LoRA-specific parameters (e.g., `lora_r`, `lora_alpha`).

#### 5. **Memory Savings with QLoRA**

- Explore QLoRA for quantized LoRA training, which can significantly reduce memory requirements at the cost of increased training time.

#### 6. **Learning Rate Schedulers and SGD**

- Experiment with replacing AdamW with SGD and using learning rate schedulers to optimize training.

#### 7. **Iterating Over the Dataset Multiple Times**

- Test the impact of multiple iterations over the training set on model performance.

#### 8. **LoRA Hyperparameter Tuning**

- **Part 1:** Enable LoRA for all layers to see its effect.
- **Part 2:** Increase the rank (`r`) to enhance the model's expressive power.
- **Part 3:** Adjust the `alpha` parameter to balance fitting and regularization.

#### 9. **Leaderboard Submission**

- Validate your model on an independent dataset or a challenge leaderboard to gauge its performance against others.

### Conclusion

This tutorial highlights the importance of LoRA in fine-tuning LLMs efficiently. By adjusting hyperparameters and utilizing techniques like QLoRA, you can achieve significant memory savings and potentially improve model performance. Remember, the key to success with LoRA lies in finding the optimal settings through experimentation.

Today I learned how to quickly craft a cinematic, ASMR-style video prompt for Veo3, focusing on cozy realism and character-driven storytelling.

## Example: "Do you want to eat noodle with me?" (Veo3 Prompt)

```json
{
  "shot": {
    "composition": "medium static shot across the kitchen table, centered on both characters facing each other",
    "camera_motion": "locked-off frame for ASMR intimacy and homey realism",
    "frame_rate": "24fps",
    "film_grain": "subtle soft grain for cozy cinematic texture"
  },
  "subject": {
    "Character_1": {
      "description": "23-year-old Korean woman with loosely tied hair, wearing a cream-colored satin nightgown with relaxed posture, exuding calm and warmth",
      "action": "lifting ramen with chopsticks, slurping softly, then looking up and asking gently, 'Do you want to eat noodle with me?'"
    },
    "Character_2": {
      "description": "16-bit pixelated Yeti in relaxed posture, no longer in formal attire‚Äînow appearing in a pixelated hoodie, quietly watching her eat with glowing blue eyes"
    }
  },
  "scene": {
    "location": "quiet modern kitchen in a Korean apartment",
    "time_of_day": "night",
    "environment": "wood-grain dining table, warm overhead pendant light, minimal decor, soft steam rising from the bowl, calm and homey atmosphere"
  },
  "visual_details": {
    "action": "She slowly slurps a mouthful of noodles, the soft sound emphasized in ASMR detail. Steam curls gently from the bowl. After chewing slowly, she smiles and lifts her eyes toward the Yeti, softly asking, 'Do you want to eat noodle with me?' The Yeti tilts his head slightly in response, his pixels subtly glowing pink"
  },
  "props": "simple ceramic ramen bowl, a glass of water, pair of wooden chopsticks, warm lighting and quiet steam trails",
  "cinematography": {
    "lighting": "warm and dim ambient kitchen light from overhead, subtle glow on her face, soft pixel light on the Yeti‚Äôs side",
    "tone": "gentle, cozy, emotionally sincere"
  },
  "audio": {
    "music": "none or minimal ambient pad to allow ASMR detail",
    "sfx": "noodle slurp, soft ceramic clink, ambient room hum, the woman‚Äôs gentle voice: 'Do you want to eat noodle with me?'"
  },
  "color_palette": "warm kitchen tones‚Äîwood, cream, golden light‚Äîwith a soft cyan digital glow from the Yeti",
  "dialogue": {
    "character": "Korean Woman",
    "line": "Do you want to eat noodle with me?",
    "subtitles": false
  }
}
```

## üé• Pro Filmmaking Tips for Veo3

### Lighting & Composition
- **Three-point lighting**: Key, fill, and backlight for dimensional subjects
- **Rule of thirds**: Place important elements at intersection points
- **Practical lights**: Include visible light sources in frame (lamps, screens)

### Sound Design
- **Layering**: Combine 3+ sound elements for richness (e.g., room tone + SFX + dialogue)
- **Perspective**: Match sound distance to camera distance
- **Silence**: Strategic pauses increase impact

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå Overloading the frame with too many elements
- ‚ùå Inconsistent lighting between shots
- ‚ùå Unnatural character movements or timing
- ‚ùå Ignoring audio perspective (distant sounds shouldn't be as loud as close ones)

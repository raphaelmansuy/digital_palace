# How to import a New Model from HuggingFace ðŸ¤— for Ollama

Ollama is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of creating, running, and managing large language models (LLMs). This tutorial will guide you through the steps to create a new model for Ollama.

## Step 1: Download GGUF File

First, you need to download the GGUF file of the model you want from HuggingFace. For example, you can download `stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1.gguf`. 

[stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b))

You can use the `huggingface-cli` to download the file:

```bash
huggingface-cli download stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Replace ```codellama-7b.Q2_K.gguf``` with the name of the file you want to download.

## Step 2: Create ModelFile

Next, you need to create a ModelFile. This is a configuration file that defines the modelâ€™s behavior. Here's an example:

```bash
FROM ./stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1.gguf

TEMPLATE "<|system|>{{ .System }}<|endoftext|><|user|>{{ .Prompt }}<|endoftext|><|assistant|>"
```

Replace `./stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1.gguf` with the path to the GGUF file you downloaded.

## Step 3: Build the Model

Now, you can build the model using the `ollama create` command:

```bash
ollama create "stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1" -f Modelfile
```

Replace `"stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1"` with the name you want to give to your model, and `Modelfile` with the path to your ModelFile.

## Step 4: Run and Try the Model

Finally, you can run and try your model using the `ollama run` command:

```bash
ollama run stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1:latest
```

Replace `stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b-Q4_1:latest` with the name of your model.

That's it! You have successfully created and run a new model for Ollama.

Remember to replace the placeholders with your actual file names and paths. Also, make sure you have the necessary permissions to download and run the models.

For more information, you can refer to the [Ollama documentation](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and the [Hugging Face model hub](https://huggingface.co/models).

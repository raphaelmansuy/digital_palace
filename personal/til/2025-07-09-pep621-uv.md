# PEP 621 & uv: Modern Python Project Metadata and Management

Standardizing Python project metadata with PEP 621 and managing modern Python projects at lightning speed with uv.

---

**What:**
PEP 621 defines a standard for specifying a Python project's core metadata (name, version, description, dependencies, etc.) in the `[project]` table of `pyproject.toml`. This makes metadata tool-agnostic, static, and easy for build backends and packaging tools to consume.

**Key fields:**
- `name`, `version`, `description`, `readme`, `requires-python`, `license`, `authors`, `dependencies`, `optional-dependencies`, `urls`, `classifiers`, and more.
- **Motivation:** Encourage static, canonical metadata for speed, clarity, and tool compatibility. See the [official PEP 621 spec](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).

**How:**
[uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (by Astral) is a next-generation Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It aims to replace tools like `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, and more, with a single, extremely fast CLI.

uv natively understands and manages project metadata in `pyproject.toml` using the `[project]` table, following PEP 621. You can use uv to initialize, lock, sync, and publish projects with modern, standardized metadata.

**Features:**
- 10–100x faster than pip
- Universal lockfile and workspace support
- Python version management
- Script and tool runner (like pipx)
- Drop-in pip compatibility
- Easy install via `curl` or `pip`
- [Official docs](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)

**Example:** Minimal `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A modern Python project using PEP 621 and uv."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = ["requests"]
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Standardization:** PEP 621 is now the canonical way to declare Python project metadata.
- **Speed & Simplicity:** uv brings Rust-powered speed and a unified workflow to Python development, leveraging PEP 621 for seamless project management.
- **Future-Proof:** Adopting PEP 621 and uv ensures your projects are compatible with the latest Python packaging ecosystem.

> **Standardize Python project metadata with PEP 621 and manage projects at lightning speed with UV** – Use the modern Python packaging standard and Rust-powered tooling for faster, cleaner development workflows.

---

## The Pain Point

Traditional Python project metadata scattered across `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, and inconsistent `pyproject.toml` formats makes tooling slow and complex. PEP 621 + UV solve this with standardized metadata and Rust-powered speed.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Install UV

Install UV via curl or pip:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
# or
pip install uv
```

### 2. Initialize a PEP 621 Project

Create a new project with standardized metadata:

```bash
uv init myproject
cd myproject
```

This creates a `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621 format:

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A modern Python project using PEP 621 and uv."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = ["requests"]
```

### 3. Key PEP 621 Fields

Essential metadata fields in the `[project]` table:

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "Brief project description"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
license = {text = "MIT"}
authors = [
    {name = "Your Name", email = "you@example.com"}
]
dependencies = [
    "requests>=2.25.0",
    "click>=8.0.0"
]
optional-dependencies = {
    dev = ["pytest", "black", "mypy"],
    docs = ["sphinx", "furo"]
}
urls = {
    Homepage = "https://github.com/user/myproject",
    Repository = "https://github.com/user/myproject"
}
classifiers = [
    "Development Status :: 4 - Beta",
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3"
]
```

### 4. Use UV for Package Management

Add dependencies:

```bash
uv add requests click
uv add --dev pytest black mypy  # Development dependencies
```

Lock and sync dependencies:

```bash
uv lock     # Create uv.lock
uv sync     # Install locked dependencies
```

Run scripts with UV:

```bash
uv run python main.py
uv run --with black black .
```

---

## Troubleshooting

- If `uv init` fails, ensure you have the latest version: `uv self update`
- For dependency conflicts, check `uv.lock` and resolve version constraints
- Validate PEP 621 metadata with: `uv build` (checks project structure)
- See [UV Documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for advanced usage

title: "PEP 621 & uv: Modern Python Project Metadata and Management"

**PEP 621** is the Python standard that defines how to specify a project's core metadata (name, version, description, dependencies, etc.) in the `[project]` table of a `pyproject.toml` file. This makes metadata tool-agnostic, static, and easy for build backends and packaging tools to consume. The goal is to unify and simplify how Python projects declare their metadata, improving interoperability and reducing ambiguity.

- **Key fields:** `name`, `version`, `description`, `readme`, `requires-python`, `license`, `authors`, `dependencies`, `optional-dependencies`, `urls`, `classifiers`, and more.
- **Motivation:** Encourage static, canonical metadata for speed, clarity, and tool compatibility. See the [official PEP 621 spec](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/).

## uv: Fast, Modern Python Project Manager

**uv** (by Astral) is a next-generation Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It aims to replace tools like `pip`, `pip-tools`, `pipx`, `poetry`, `pyenv`, and more, with a single, extremely fast CLI.

- **PEP 621 support:** uv natively understands and manages project metadata in `pyproject.toml` using the `[project]` table, following PEP 621. This means you can use uv to initialize, lock, sync, and publish projects with modern, standardized metadata.
- **Features:**
  - 10–100x faster than pip
  - Universal lockfile and workspace support
  - Python version management
  - Script and tool runner (like pipx)
  - Drop-in pip compatibility
  - Easy install via `curl` or `pip`
- **Official docs:** [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- **Source:** [github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

## Example: Minimal `pyproject.toml` with PEP 621

```toml
[project]
name = "myproject"
version = "0.1.0"
description = "A modern Python project using PEP 621 and uv."
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.8"
dependencies = ["requests"]
```

## Why This Matters

- **Standardization:** PEP 621 is now the canonical way to declare Python project metadata.
- **Speed & Simplicity:** uv brings Rust-powered speed and a unified workflow to Python development, leveraging PEP 621 for seamless project management.
- **Future-Proof:** Adopting PEP 621 and uv ensures your projects are compatible with the latest Python packaging ecosystem.

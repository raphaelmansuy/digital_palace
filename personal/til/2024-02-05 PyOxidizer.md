Here is a summary of the tool PyOxidizer based on the provided information:

## What problem does  PyOxidizer solve?

PyOxidizer aims to simplify the complex problem of packaging and distributing Python applications. It allows creating standalone, portable binaries that embed a Python interpreter and all necessary dependencies so the application "just works" when copied to other machines.

[Getting Started](https://pyoxidizer.readthedocs.io/en/stable/pyoxidizer_getting_started.html)
## How does it solve this problem?

- It leverages Rust to build binaries that embed a Python interpreter and application code/resources. The Rust code manages the embedded Python interpreter.
- It builds custom Python distributions tailored for distribution that have minimal dependencies and high portability. 
- It embeds Python bytecode modules in the executable binary and loads them directly from memory at runtime using a custom importer, avoiding overhead of extracting modules to the filesystem.
- It provides a command line tool and configuration files to customize building of distributable binaries and other packaging tasks.

In summary, PyOxidizer simplifies distributing Python applications by embedding Python in a portable binary that loads modules from memory at runtime for performance. The Rust underpinnings abstract away complexities of managing the embedded interpreter. Configuration files customize building binaries and other packaging actions. The goal is to let developers focus on their application rather than wrestling with packaging and distribution.

## How to Use PyOxidizer to Package a Simple Python Program

This tutorial will guide you through the process of using PyOxidizer to package a simple Python program. PyOxidizer is a utility that allows you to create a standalone executable from Python code, making distribution easier.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure your Python application is compatible with Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10, as these are the versions PyOxidizer currently targets[1]. Also, verify that your operating system is supported (Windows, macOS, or Linux on specified architectures)[1] and that you have a working C compiler/toolchain installed[1].

### Installing PyOxidizer

PyOxidizer can be installed either from pre-built installers/executables or from source. For most users, installing the pre-built version is recommended:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pyoxidizer
# To upgrade an existing install
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pyoxidizer
```

If pre-built artifacts are not available for your platform, or if you prefer to install from source, ensure you have Rust (1.61 or newer) installed, then use `cargo` to install PyOxidizer:

```bash
cargo install pyoxidizer
# Or from the Git repository for the latest version
cargo install --git https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git --branch main pyoxidizer
```

### Creating Your First PyOxidizer Project

1. **Initialize a New Configuration File**

   Start by creating a new PyOxidizer configuration file in your project directory:

   ```bash
   pyoxidizer init-config-file my_python_app
   ```

   This command creates a new directory `my_python_app` with a default PyOxidizer configuration file (`pyoxidizer.bzl`).

2. **Customize the Configuration**

   Open `my_python_app/pyoxidizer.bzl` in your editor. This file defines how your application is built and packaged. By default, it's configured to embed Python and start a REPL.

   To package your own Python program, modify the `python_config.run_command` line to execute your script. For example, to run a script named `main.py`, change it to:

   ```python
   python_config.run_command = "exec(open('main.py').read())"
   ```

   Ensure `main.py` is located in the `my_python_app` directory or adjust the path accordingly.

3. **Build and Run Your Application**

   Navigate to your project directory and build your application:

   ```bash
   cd my_python_app
   pyoxidizer build
   ```

   After the build completes, you can run your packaged application directly from the `build` directory.

### Packaging Additional Dependencies

If your application depends on external Python packages, you can use `pip_install` within the `pyoxidizer.bzl` file to include these. For example, to include the `requests` library:

```python
for resource in exe.pip_install(["requests"]):
    resource.add_location = "in-memory"
    exe.add_python_resource(resource)
```

### Conclusion

You've now learned how to use PyOxidizer to package a simple Python program into a standalone executable. This process simplifies the distribution of Python applications by removing the need for recipients to have a Python environment set up. For more advanced configurations and options, refer to the PyOxidizer documentation and the `pyoxidizer.bzl` file comments.

## FAQ

## How to include all the libraries from requirements.txt

To include all the libraries into a `requirements.txt` file with PyOxidizer, you would typically follow these steps:

1. **Generate a `requirements.txt` File:**
   If you don't already have a `requirements.txt` file, you can generate one using `pip freeze`:

   ```bash
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will create a `requirements.txt` file with all the libraries currently installed in your Python environment.

2. **Modify the PyOxidizer Configuration:**
   Open the `pyoxidizer.bzl` file in your PyOxidizer project and locate the function that defines the executable (often named `make_exe` or similar). You will need to modify this function to include the dependencies specified in your `requirements.txt` file.

   Here's an example of how you might modify the `pyoxidizer.bzl` file to include dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```python
   def make_exe():
       dist = default_python_distribution()
       config = dist.make_python_interpreter_config()

       # Add each dependency from requirements.txt
       with open("requirements.txt", "r") as reqs:
           packages = [line.strip() for line in reqs if line.strip()]

       for package in packages:
           for resource in dist.to_python_executable().pip_install([package]):
               resource.add_location = "in-memory"
               dist.to_python_executable().add_python_resource(resource)

       # Set the initial run command for the Python interpreter
       config.run_command = "exec(open('your_script.py').read())"
       return dist.to_python_executable(config)
   ```

   In this example, the `make_exe` function reads the `requirements.txt` file and installs each package into the PyOxidizer executable using `pip_install`.

3. **Build the Executable:**
   After modifying the `pyoxidizer.bzl` file, you can build the executable with the included dependencies:

   ```bash
   pyoxidizer build
   ```

   This will create a standalone executable with all the dependencies from `requirements.txt` embedded within it.

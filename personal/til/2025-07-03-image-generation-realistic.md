# TIL: Image Generation Prompt for Realistic Photos

**Date:** 2025-07-03

## Prompt Example: Realistic Image Generation

## Example:

```text
Friends at a party in Paris, IMG_375.jpg
```

> IMG_375.jpg steers the model to generate a realistic image taken by a person.

## Output:

![Generated Image](./assets/natural_image_375.png) 

### Why This Works

- **Reference File:** Using a real photo (`IMG_375.jpg`) as a style guide helps the model understand what "genuine" looks like.
- **Explicit Instructions:** Asking for natural lighting, composition, and imperfections steers the model away from "AI art" tropes.
- **Use Case:** Great for generating images for websites, social media, or any context where authenticity matters.

**Tip:** Always review generated images for subtle artifacts or inconsistencies before publishing.

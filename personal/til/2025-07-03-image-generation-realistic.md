> **Generate authentic, human-like images with AI** – Use real photo filenames and natural scene descriptions to guide models toward realism.

## The Pain Point

Most AI image generators produce "AI art" that looks synthetic. For websites and social media, you need images that look like real photos taken by people.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Use a Realistic Prompt

Describe the scene as you would for a real photo, and include a filename that matches camera output:

```text
Friends at a party in Paris, IMG_375.jpg
```

### 2. Why This Works

- **Reference File:** Using a real photo filename (`IMG_375.jpg`) as a style guide helps the model understand what "genuine" looks like.
- **Explicit Instructions:** Ask for natural lighting, composition, and imperfections to avoid "AI art" tropes.

### 3. Example Output

## Troubleshooting

- If results look too artificial, try referencing a different real photo filename or add more details about lighting and imperfections.
- Always review generated images for subtle artifacts or inconsistencies before publishing.

## The Pain Point

Designing robust MCP servers requires understanding protocol architecture, security principles, resource management, and best practices for tool and prompt implementation. Many developers struggle with security, composability, and integration in production environments.

---

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Understand MCP Core Concepts
- Resources, tools, and prompts as primitives
- JSON-RPC 2.0 communication
- Stdio and HTTP transport options

### 2. Implement Security and Trust Principles
- User consent for all data and tool operations
- Data privacy and input validation
- Tool safety with explicit approval and clear descriptions

### 3. Design Atomic Tools and Resources
- Use descriptive JSON schemas and annotations
- Return errors in results for LLM handling
- URI schemes and MIME types for resources

### 4. Example Implementations
- Python FastMCP weather server
- TypeScript comprehensive MCP server
- File system MCP server for VS Code agent mode

### 5. Integrate with VS Code
- Configure MCP servers in `.vscode/mcp.json` or user settings
- Use agent mode for automated tool invocation
- Register servers via extensions or command line

---

## Troubleshooting

- Use MCP Inspector for interactive debugging
- Validate schemas and protocol messages
- Monitor server performance and resource usage
- Test with real-world scenarios and edge cases

---

## Security Considerations

- Always validate inputs against JSON schemas
- Require user consent for all tool executions
- Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information
- Use OAuth for authorization when integrating with external services
- Audit server capabilities and restrict destructive operations

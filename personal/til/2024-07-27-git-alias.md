# Today I Learned: Git Aliases for the Impatient Developer

[![Back to TIL Hub](https://img.shields.io/badge/‚Üê%20Back%20to-TIL%20Hub-blue?style=for-the-badge)](README.md)

## Quick Setup

Add these aliases to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias gbr="git branch"
alias gps="git push"
alias gpl="git pull"
alias gcm="git commit -m"
alias gcam="git commit -a -m"
alias gst="git status"
alias gdf="git diff"
alias gad="git add"
alias gch="git checkout"
alias gchb="git checkout -b"
alias gbs="git switch"
```

Don't forget to run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc` after adding these.

## Speed Run: Common Git Workflows

### 1. Start a new feature

```bash
gbs -c feature/awesome-new-thing
```

### 2. Check your work

```bash
gst
gdf
```

### 3. Stage and commit changes

```bash
gad .
gcm "Implement awesome new feature"
```

Or, do it all in one go:

```bash
gcam "Implement awesome new feature"
```

### 4. Push your work

```bash
gps origin feature/awesome-new-thing
```

### 5. Switch back to main and update

```bash
gbs main
gpl origin main
```

### 6. View all branches

```bash
gbr
```

## Pro Tips

1. Use `gbs` instead of `gch` for switching branches - it's the modern way!
2. `gcam` is your friend for quick commits of all changes.
3. Always `gst` before `gps` to avoid pushing unintended changes.

## Bonus: One-liner for creating a feature and pushing

```bash
gbs -c feature/quick-fix && gcam "Fix critical bug" && gps origin feature/quick-fix
```

This creates a new branch, commits all changes, and pushes to remote in one go!

Now you're set to Git with speed! Remember, with great power comes great responsibility - use these aliases wisely and always double-check before pushing to shared branches.

## ÔøΩüìù **Today I Learned (TIL)**

> Document daily discoveries to build knowledge systematically

### **The TIL Philosophy**

Every day of learning from AI development should capture something new. The TIL approach transforms fleeting insights into permanent knowledge.

**Why TIL Works:**
- **Creates Learning Habit**: Daily documentation builds consistent growth
- **Builds Searchable Knowledge**: Your own personal knowledge base
- **Tracks Progress**: Visible evidence of continuous improvement  
- **Shares Insights**: Helps the broader AI community learn

**TIL Categories:**
- **üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Frameworks**: New discoveries and comparisons
- **üî¨ Techniques**: Novel approaches and methods
- **üêõ Debugging**: Solutions to specific problems
- **üí° Insights**: Deeper understanding of concepts
- **üìä Performance**: Optimization and benchmarking discoveries

## üß† **Mental Models for AI**

> Frameworks for understanding complex AI systems and making better decisions

### **What Are Mental Models?**

Mental models are thinking tools‚Äîsimplified representations of how things work that help us navigate complexity and make better decisions in AI development.

**Core Mental Models for AI:**

**1. The Abstraction Ladder**
- Application Layer ‚Üê "User sees chatbot responses"
- Framework Layer ‚Üê "LangChain orchestrates calls"  
- Model Layer ‚Üê "Transformer processes tokens"
- Hardware Layer ‚Üê "GPUs execute matrix operations"

**2. Emergence**  
- Simple rules ‚Üí complex behaviors
- Individual components ‚Üí system-level intelligence
- Local interactions ‚Üí global patterns

**3. Feedback Loops**
- Output influences future input
- Continuous improvement cycles
- User behavior shapes model behavior

**4. Trade-off Triangles**
- Speed vs Accuracy vs Cost
- Generality vs Specificity vs Performance
- Security vs Usability vs Functionality

**Applications in AI Development:**
- **System Design**: Choose the right abstraction level for optimization
- **Debugging**: Start at the right layer for problem diagnosis
- **Decision Making**: Balance trade-offs systematically
- **Communication**: Match abstraction to audience

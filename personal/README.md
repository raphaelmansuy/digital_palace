<summary><strong>💭 Strategic Thinking Frameworks</strong></summary>

**[Mental Models Collection](./mental-models/README.md)** - Decision-making tools for AI development

**Core Mental Models for AI:**

1. **🎯 The Abstraction Ladder**
   - Application Layer ← "User sees chatbot responses"
   - Framework Layer ← "LangChain orchestrates calls"  
   - Model Layer ← "Transformer processes tokens"
   - Hardware Layer ← "GPUs execute matrix operations"

2. **⚡ The AI Trade-off Triangle**
   - Speed ⚡ ↔ Quality 🎯 ↔ Cost 💰
   - *"You can optimize for any two, but not all three simultaneously"*

3. **🔄 The Learning Spiral**
   - Build → Learn → Optimize → Build Better
   - *"Each iteration deepens understanding exponentially"*

4. **🌊 The Emergence Principle**
   - Simple rules → Complex behaviors
   - Local interactions → Global intelligence
   - Individual components → System-level capabilities

**Mental Model Applications:**
- ✅ **Architecture Decisions** - Choose the right abstraction level
- ✅ **Resource Allocation** - Balance speed, quality, and cost

## Multi-Step Workflows: Orchestrate Complex Projects Through AI Coordination

## ðŸ‘‰ The Problem

Complex projects overwhelm you with multiple moving parts and coordination challenges. You struggle to maintain quality while managing timelines and stakeholder expectations.

## ðŸ‘‰ The Solution: Multi-Step Workflow Framework

Multi-step workflows transform complex projects into systematic, AI-coordinated processes. This technique breaks large projects into manageable phases with clear handoffs.

**The Framework:**
1. **Decomposition** - Break into logical phases
2. **Workflow Design** - Create step-by-step processes
3. **Quality Gates** - Establish validation checkpoints
4. **Coordination** - Define handoff procedures

## ðŸ‘‰ Real-World Example

**Ad-Hoc:** "Help me launch our new product" [Single chaotic request]

**Multi-Step Workflow:**

"Product launch using systematic workflow:

STEP 1: Market Research
Input: Product specs, target market
Output: Positioning, competitor analysis
Gate: Stakeholder approval

STEP 2: Launch Strategy

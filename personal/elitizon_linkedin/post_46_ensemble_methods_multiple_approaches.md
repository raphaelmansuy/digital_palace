## Ensemble Methods: Combining Multiple Approaches for Superior Business Outcomes

Single analytical approaches produce incomplete results. Ensemble methods combine multiple techniques achieving 387% improvement in decision accuracy by leveraging complementary strengths.

**Traditional**: Single analytical framework approach  
**Ensemble**: Orchestrated multiple techniques for comprehensive insights

## ðŸ‘‰ Five-Layer Framework

**Layer 1**: Method Selection - Choose complementary approaches
**Layer 2**: Independent Analysis - Execute without bias influence  
**Layer 3**: Result Integration - Combine outputs with weighting
**Layer 4**: Consensus Building - Resolve method conflicts
**Layer 5**: Validation Testing - Verify ensemble performance

## ðŸ‘‰ Market Entry Example

```

## Self-Verification: Systematic Solution Scoring for Optimal Decision Making

Organizations choose suboptimal solutions due to inconsistent evaluation methods. Self-verification creates objective scoring systems achieving 289% improvement in solution selection accuracy.

**Traditional**: Subjective decisions based on gut feelings and politics
**Self-Verification**: Systematic scoring across measurable criteria

## ðŸ‘‰ Six-Dimension Scoring Matrix

**Dimension 1**: Feasibility Score - Technical and resource requirements
**Dimension 2**: Impact Score - Business value and outcome magnitude  
**Dimension 3**: Risk Score - Implementation risks and mitigation
**Dimension 4**: Resource Score - Time, cost, capability requirements
**Dimension 5**: Alignment Score - Strategic fit and stakeholder support
**Dimension 6**: Sustainability Score - Long-term viability

## ðŸ‘‰ CRM Platform Example

```
Options: Salesforce vs HubSpot vs Custom Development
Feasibility: HubSpot 8.75/10, Salesforce 7.5/10, Custom 5.5/10
Impact: Systematic scoring across all 6 dimensions
Resource: Weighted analysis with bias verification
Result: HubSpot selected with transparent rationale
```

## ðŸ‘‰ Business Impact

- **Selection Accuracy**: 289% improvement in optimal solutions
- **Success Rates**: Increase from 42% to 87%
- **Timeline Accuracy**: 156% improvement in implementation
- **Resource Optimization**: 67% reduction in post-adjustments

## ðŸ‘‰ Your Implementation

1. **Audit**: Identify 3 recent decisions needing systematic scoring
2. **Framework**: Create weighted criteria for common decisions
3. **Protocol**: Develop consistency checks and bias mitigation
4. **Pilot**: Apply scoring to upcoming solution selection
5. **Track**: Measure success rate improvement over 90 days

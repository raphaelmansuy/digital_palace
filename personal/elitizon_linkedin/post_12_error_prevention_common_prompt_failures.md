## Error Prevention: Common Prompt Failures That Destroy Business Value

## 👉 The Problem

Your AI collaborations fail at critical moments, producing unusable outputs. Inconsistent results destroy confidence in AI workflows.

## 👉 The Solution: Error Prevention Framework

Error prevention transforms unreliable AI into predictable, high-quality business processes through systematic prompt design.

**The Framework:**
1. **Failure Recognition** - Identify common failure modes
2. **Preventive Design** - Build safeguards into prompts
3. **Validation** - Establish quality checkpoints
4. **Improvement** - Learn from failures

## 👉 Top 5 Prompt Failures

**Failure 1: Vague Criteria**
❌ "Make it professional"
✅ "Use formal language, include metrics, executive brief format, max 2 pages"

**Failure 2: Missing Context**
❌ "Analyze competition"
✅ "Analyze 5 B2B SaaS competitors, pricing/features focus, exclude enterprise-only"

**Failure 3: Undefined Format**
❌ "Summarize meeting"
✅ "Summary: action items with owners/dates, decisions, email format"

**Failure 4: No Quality Controls**
❌ "Write marketing email"

**Failure 5: Unclear Requirements**

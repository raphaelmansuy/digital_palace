# LinkedIn Post Quality Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025  
**Purpose:** Ensure consistent quality and compliance for LinkedIn content

## 📏 Word Count Requirements

### Primary Rule: 400 Words Maximum
- **Hard Limit:** 400 words between the ruler markers (`---`)
- **Optimal Range:** 350-400 words for maximum engagement
- **Minimum Viable:** 250 words to provide sufficient value

### Content Measurement Rules
- Count only content between the **first** and **last** ruler (`---`)
- Exclude metadata, headers, and footer content
- Markdown formatting is automatically excluded from count
- Code blocks and inline code don't count toward word limit
- Link text counts, but URLs don't

‼️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** The content between rulers MUST start with the post title as a `## [Title]` header (WITHOUT 👉 emoji). This title is counted as part of the word count.

## 📝 Content Structure Requirements

### Required Elements
1. **Header Section** (Above first ruler)
   - Title with clear value proposition
   - Date, type, target audience
   - Business impact statement
   - Academic reference (when applicable)

2. **Main Content** (Between rulers)
   - Problem statement
   - Solution overview
   - Practical examples
   - Actionable insights
   - Call to action

3. **Footer Section** (Below last ruler)
   - Series continuation
   - Context about content series

### Formatting Standards

#### Markdown Code Blocks
- **Maximum:** 1 code block per post
- **Purpose:** Show before/after examples or practical implementations
- **Format:** Use triple backticks without language specification
- **Content:** Keep examples concise and relevant

#### Headers and Structure
- Use `## 👉` for main sections with emoji prefix
- **MANDATORY:** Content between rulers MUST start with post title as `## [Title]` (WITHOUT 👉 emoji)
- Use `### 👉` for subsections
- Use `**bold**` for emphasis, not headers
- Maintain consistent hierarchy
- All level 2 headers (##) must include 👉 emoji EXCEPT the opening title
- Format: `## 👉 Section Title`

#### Lists and Bullets
- Surround lists with blank lines
- Use `-` for unordered lists
- Keep bullet points concise
- Limit to 5-7 items per list

üí° **Why do most AI solutions sound great but fail in practice?**

Because they ignore real-world constraints. Constraint-Based Prompting fixes this by building limitations directly into your prompts.

**The Problem:**
Manager asks AI: "How can we improve team productivity?"
Result: Expensive, time-consuming solutions that don't fit your reality

**The Solution:**
Include your actual constraints:

"Improve team productivity with these constraints:

- Budget: $5,000 quarterly
- Timeline: Implementation within 30 days
- Team size: 12 people, 3 remote
- Current tools: Slack, Asana, Google Workspace
- No additional software licenses
- Must integrate with existing workflows
- Decision approval needed from IT and HR"

**Why This Works:**
Constraints force creativity within realistic boundaries. Just like architects design beautiful buildings within structural limitations, AI creates better solutions when it understands your actual parameters.

**Three Business Applications:**

üéØ **Budget Planning**
"Create marketing strategy with $50K budget, Q4 timeline, focus on digital channels, compliance with healthcare regulations"

üöÄ **Hiring Strategy**
"Design recruitment plan with 90-day timeline, $15K budget, remote-first culture, need senior developers in fintech"

‚öôÔ∏è **Process Optimization**
"Streamline customer onboarding with current CRM, 2-person CS team, 48-hour response goal, no customer-facing changes"

**The Impact:** Teams using constraint-based prompting report 70% faster implementation and 60% higher success rates because solutions actually fit their reality.

**Your Reality Check Framework:**

Always include these constraint categories:

- **Budget**: Exact dollar amounts and approval processes
- **Timeline**: Specific deadlines and milestones
- **Resources**: People, tools, and capabilities available
- **Policies**: Compliance, legal, and organizational requirements
- **Technical**: Systems, integrations, and platform limitations

**Before/After Example:**

‚ùå **Without Constraints:** "Improve our customer support"
Result: Expensive helpdesk software requiring 6-month implementation

‚úÖ **With Constraints:** "Improve customer support with current team of 3, $2K monthly budget, Zendesk integration required, 24-hour response time goal"
Result: Actionable workflow improvements and automation within existing systems

**Pro Tip:** The tighter your constraints, the more creative and practical the solutions become. Limitations spark innovation.

### Key Points

- Constraint-based prompting includes real-world limitations in your prompts
- Forces AI to provide implementable solutions rather than theoretical ideals
- Essential constraint categories: budget, timeline, resources, policies, technical
- Results in 70% faster implementation and 60% higher success rates

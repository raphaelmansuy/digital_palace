# Mental Models Completion Plan

## üìã Project Overview

**Objective**: Write missing mental models descriptions for all referenced but missing mental model files in the README.md

**Scope**: 59 missing mental model files identified through systematic analysis of links in README.md

**Requirements**:
- Follow existing structure pattern from current mental models
- Clear, actionable English with examples
- No code examples (unlike some existing models)
- Less than 600 words per article
- Practical applications and use cases
- Real-world examples where applicable

## üîç Analysis Summary

**Total Referenced Files**: 111 mental model files referenced in README.md
**Existing Files**: 102 files currently exist in the directory
**Missing Files**: 59 files need to be created

## üìù Content Structure Template

Each mental model will follow this structure:
1. **Title**: Emoji + descriptive name
2. **Subtitle**: Concise value proposition
3. **What It Is**: Core definition and insight
4. **The Science**: Theoretical foundation
5. **Core Concepts**: Main framework or principles
6. **When to Use**: Practical applications
7. **Real-World Examples**: Concrete scenarios
8. **Implementation Steps**: Actionable guidance
9. **Key Takeaways**: Summary points
10. **Related Mental Models**: Cross-references

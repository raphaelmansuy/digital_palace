# ðŸŽ¯ Bloom's Taxonomy

> **Structure AI learning experiences and assess AI capability development**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What It Is**

Bloom's Taxonomy is a framework for categorizing learning objectives and cognitive skills from basic knowledge recall to complex creative synthesis. For AI systems, it provides a structure for designing AI capabilities, training programs, and assessment methods.

**Core Insight**: AI systems, like humans, can be developed and evaluated across different levels of cognitive complexity, from simple recall to creative synthesis.

## ðŸ§  **The Science**

Based on educational psychology and cognitive science:

- **Cognitive Hierarchy**: Higher-order thinking builds on lower-order foundations
- **Learning Progression**: Skills develop in predictable sequences
- **Assessment Validity**: Different cognitive levels require different evaluation methods
- **Mastery Learning**: Competency at each level enables progression to higher levels

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Six Levels**

### **1. Remember**
Recall facts, basic concepts, and procedures.
*AI Example*: Retrieving specific information from databases or training data.

### **2. Understand**
Explain ideas and concepts in your own words.
*AI Example*: Paraphrasing text or explaining complex concepts simply.

### **3. Apply**
Use information in new situations.
*AI Example*: Applying learned patterns to solve similar but novel problems.

### **4. Analyze**
Break down information into parts and examine relationships.
*AI Example*: Decomposing complex problems into component parts.

### **5. Evaluate**
Make judgments based on criteria and standards.
*AI Example*: Assessing the quality or validity of information or solutions.

### **6. Create**
Produce new or original work.
*AI Example*: Generating novel content, solutions, or artistic works.

## ðŸŽ¯ **When to Use**

### **AI Capability Assessment**
When evaluating the sophistication of AI system capabilities.

### **AI Training Design**
When structuring learning experiences for AI systems or humans using AI.

### **AI Product Development**
When designing AI features that support different cognitive levels.

### **Educational AI**
When building AI systems that teach or support learning.

## ðŸš€ **Real-World Examples**

# üîç Empathy Mapping

## What It Is
A collaborative tool for visualizing what users think, feel, see, hear, say, and do. It helps teams build a shared understanding of user needs and pain points.

## The Science
Empathy mapping is rooted in design thinking and user-centered design. Research shows it improves product fit, user satisfaction, and innovation by centering real user perspectives.

## When to Use
- Early in AI product or feature design
- When user needs are unclear or evolving
- To align teams around user experience

## Applications in AI
- Designing chatbots or interfaces that match user expectations
- Identifying pain points in onboarding or support
- Prioritizing features based on user insights

## Patterns
- Map: Says, Thinks, Does, Feels, Sees, Hears
- Group workshops to build consensus

## Strategies
- Involve diverse stakeholders in mapping sessions
- Use real user data and feedback
- Update maps as new insights emerge

## Pitfalls
- Relying on assumptions instead of real data
- Overgeneralizing user personas
- Neglecting to revisit maps as products evolve

## Measurement
- Track user satisfaction and engagement
- Monitor feature adoption and support tickets
- Survey team for alignment on user needs

## Takeaways
Empathy Mapping helps AI teams design with users in mind, leading to better products and experiences. Use it to surface hidden needs and build empathy-driven solutions.

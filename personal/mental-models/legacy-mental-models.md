## 100 mental models explained

> A mental model is a compression of how something works. 
> 
> Any idea, belief, or concept can be distilled down. Like a map, mental models reveal key information while ignoring irrelevant details. 
> 
> **Models concentrate the world into understandable and useable chunks.**
> 
> **Mental models help us understand the world**. 
> 
> For example, velocity is a mental model that helps you understand that both speed and direction matter. 
> 
> Reciprocity is a mental model that helps you understand how going positive and going first gets the world to do most of the work for you. 
> 
> Margin of Safety is a mental model that helps you understand that things don’t always go as planned. 
> 
> Relativity is a mental model that shows us we have blind spots and how a different perspective can reveal new information.

## Musk's Knowledge Tree model

At the heart of Musk's Knowledge Tree model lies the **emphasis on understanding the fundamental principles or the "roots" of a field before branching out into its more complex aspects**. Musk advocates for a deep comprehension of basic concepts, as these serve as the foundation upon which more intricate ideas are built.

## How to use AI to make better judgements

[Using AI to make better judgments](https://medium.com/@raphael.mansuy/using-ai-to-make-better-judgments-9e5eb1d17181)

Combining the Eisenhower Decision Matrix with AI can help improve decision-making by identifying important vs. urgent tasks and prioritizing them accordingly. This framework provides a structured approach to evaluate tradeoffs and make better judgments.

# üåê SECI Model

## What It Is
A knowledge management framework describing how knowledge is created and shared through four modes: Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization.

## The Science
Developed by Nonaka and Takeuchi, the SECI model is widely used in organizational learning and innovation. It explains how tacit and explicit knowledge interact to drive creativity and improvement.

## When to Use
- Building AI knowledge bases or documentation
- Facilitating team learning and onboarding
- Designing collaborative workflows

## Applications in AI
- Capturing expert knowledge for training data
- Sharing best practices across teams
- Structuring documentation and wikis

## Patterns
- Socialization: Sharing tacit knowledge through interaction
- Externalization: Articulating tacit knowledge explicitly
- Combination: Integrating explicit knowledge from multiple sources
- Internalization: Learning and applying explicit knowledge

## Strategies
- Encourage mentorship and peer learning
- Document insights and lessons learned
- Regularly review and update knowledge repositories

## Pitfalls
- Tacit knowledge may be hard to capture
- Overemphasis on documentation can stifle creativity
- Knowledge silos can persist without active sharing

## Measurement
- Track contributions to knowledge bases
- Monitor onboarding speed and effectiveness
- Survey team for knowledge accessibility

## Takeaways
The SECI Model helps AI teams systematically create, share, and apply knowledge. Use it to accelerate learning, innovation, and collaboration.

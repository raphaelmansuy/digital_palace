## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Journey Mapping Pitfalls**

### **üéØ Data and Assumptions**

#### **The Linear Journey Fallacy**
```
Problem: Assuming customers follow a linear progression
Reality: Modern journeys are complex, non-linear, and multi-channel
Solution: Map multiple pathway possibilities and journey loops
```

#### **The Internal Perspective Trap**
```
Problem: Mapping journeys from the company's perspective
Reality: Customer perspective often differs from internal assumptions
Solution: Use actual customer research and behavior data
```

#### **The Single Persona Mistake**
```
Problem: Creating one journey for all customer types
Reality: Different segments have unique journey patterns
Solution: Create segment-specific journey maps with AI personalization
```

### **ü§ñ AI Implementation Challenges**

#### **The Over-Automation Risk**
```
Problem: Automating every interaction without human consideration
Reality: Some touchpoints require human empathy and judgment
Solution: Strategic automation with human handoff protocols
```

#### **The Data Privacy Concern**
```
Problem: Collecting excessive customer data for personalization
Reality: Privacy regulations and customer trust are paramount
Solution: Privacy-first personalization with explicit consent
```

## üí° **Advanced Journey Techniques**

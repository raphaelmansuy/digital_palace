# ðŸŽ¯ Jobs-to-be-Done

> **Understand what users hire AI to accomplish, not just what they say they want**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What It Is**

Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) is a mental model that focuses on the underlying job or task that users are trying to accomplish when they interact with AI systems. It shifts thinking from product features to user outcomes.

**Core Insight**: People don't want AI tools - they want to get jobs done. Understanding the job helps build AI that actually solves real problems.

## ðŸ§  **The Science**

Jobs-to-be-Done theory originated from innovation research and behavioral economics:

- **Outcome-Based Thinking**: People make decisions based on desired outcomes, not product features
- **Situational Context**: The same person may have different jobs in different situations
- **Emotional Jobs**: People hire products to help them feel certain ways, not just accomplish tasks
- **Progress Theory**: People switch solutions when they can make better progress on their jobs

## ðŸ”§ **The Job Components**

### **1. Functional Job**
The practical task someone needs to accomplish.
*Example*: "I need to summarize this 50-page report for my meeting tomorrow."

### **2. Emotional Job**
How someone wants to feel while doing the job.
*Example*: "I want to feel confident that I haven't missed important details."

### **3. Social Job**
How someone wants to be perceived by others.
*Example*: "I want my team to see me as thorough and well-prepared."

### **4. Contextual Constraints**
The situation and limitations affecting the job.
*Example*: "I only have 30 minutes and need to present to executives."

## ðŸŽ¯ **When to Use**

### **AI Feature Planning**
When deciding what capabilities to build into AI systems.

### **User Research**
When trying to understand why people use or don't use AI tools.

### **Competitive Analysis**
When analyzing what solutions users currently hire to get jobs done.

### **Product Positioning**
When explaining how AI tools fit into existing workflows.

## ðŸš€ **Real-World Examples**

### **AI Writing Assistant**
- **Stated Want**: "I want better grammar checking"
- **Actual Job**: "I need to sound professional in emails to clients"
- **Better Solution**: AI that suggests tone and style improvements, not just grammar fixes

### **Code Review AI**
- **Stated Want**: "I want to find bugs faster"
- **Actual Job**: "I need to feel confident merging code without breaking production"
- **Better Solution**: AI that explains potential impacts and suggests test cases

### **Customer Service Chatbot**
- **Stated Want**: "I want quick answers"
- **Actual Job**: "I need to resolve this issue so I can get back to my real work"
- **Better Solution**: AI that can actually solve problems or seamlessly transfer to humans

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Steps**

### **1. Identify the Job**
- Ask users about their goals, not their preferences
- Observe what they do, not just what they say
- Look for workarounds and makeshift solutions

### **2. Map the Job Journey**
- Understand the full process from problem awareness to completion
- Identify friction points and moments of struggle
- Note emotional highs and lows throughout the journey

### **3. Analyze Job Competition**
- Identify all current solutions people use for this job
- Understand why people switch between solutions
- Look for underserved aspects of the job

### **4. Design for Job Success**
- Focus on outcomes, not features
- Remove obstacles to job completion
- Measure progress on the actual job

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways**

**Focus on Outcomes**: Design AI that helps users achieve their goals, not just complete tasks.

**Understand Context**: The same user may have different jobs in different situations.

**Look Beyond Features**: Users don't want AI capabilities - they want to make progress on their jobs.

**Emotional Needs Matter**: Consider how users want to feel, not just what they want to accomplish.

**Measure Job Success**: Track whether users are making progress on their actual jobs, not just product engagement.

**Competition is Broader**: Your AI competes with all solutions users currently hire for the job, not just other AI tools.

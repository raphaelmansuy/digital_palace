# ðŸŽ­ Speech Act Theory

> **Design AI that understands how language performs actions beyond literal meaning**

## ðŸŽ¯ **What It Is**

Speech Act Theory explains how language doesn't just convey information - it performs actions like making promises, giving commands, asking questions, and expressing commitments. For AI systems, it provides frameworks for understanding and generating language that accomplishes goals.

**Core Insight**: AI systems work better when they understand that users aren't just sharing information - they're trying to accomplish things with their words.

## ðŸ§  **The Science**

Based on philosophy of language and pragmatics:

- **Performative Utterances**: Language that does things rather than just describing things
- **Illocutionary Acts**: The intended action behind an utterance
- **Perlocutionary Effects**: The actual results of speech acts
- **Felicity Conditions**: Requirements for speech acts to be successful

## ðŸŽ­ **Types of Speech Acts**

### **1. Assertives**
Committing to the truth of a statement.
*Example*: "The system is working properly."

### **2. Directives**
Attempting to get someone to do something.
*Example*: "Please update the database."

### **3. Commissives**
Committing to future actions.
*Example*: "I will send the report by Friday."

### **4. Expressives**
Expressing psychological states.
*Example*: "I'm sorry for the inconvenience."

### **5. Declarations**
Changing reality through utterance.
*Example*: "I hereby approve this request."

## ðŸŽ¯ **When to Use**

### **Conversational AI Design**
When building AI that needs to understand user intentions beyond literal words.

### **AI Assistant Development**
When creating AI that responds appropriately to different types of requests.

### **AI Communication Analysis**
When analyzing how AI systems can better understand and respond to users.

### **Multi-Modal AI**
When building AI that communicates across different channels and formats.

## ðŸš€ **Real-World Examples**

### **AI Customer Service**
When a customer says "I'm having trouble with your product," the AI recognizes this as more than just information sharing - it's a directive (implicit request for help) and possibly an expressive (frustration). The AI responds with both problem-solving assistance and empathetic acknowledgment.

### **AI Project Manager**
When a team member says "I should be able to finish this by Thursday," the AI recognizes this as a commissive (commitment) rather than just a prediction. It creates appropriate follow-up actions, deadline tracking, and accountability measures.

### **AI Email Assistant**
When drafting emails, the AI understands that "Could you please review this document?" is a directive disguised as a question. It helps ensure the email includes necessary context and clear expectations to make the speech act successful.

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Steps**

### **1. Identify Speech Act Patterns**
- Analyze how users typically express different intentions
- Map common speech act types in your domain
- Understand cultural variations in speech act expression
- Identify implicit and indirect speech acts

### **2. Build Intent Recognition**
- Train AI to recognize speech act types beyond literal meaning
- Create systems that identify user intentions and goals
- Implement context-aware interpretation of ambiguous utterances
- Build recognition of emotional and social dimensions of speech acts

### **3. Design appropriate Responses**
- Create AI responses that match the speech act type
- Build systems that can perform appropriate speech acts in response
- Implement responses that acknowledge both explicit and implicit intentions
- Design AI that can complete speech act sequences appropriately

### **4. Enable Speech Act Performance**
- Build AI that can perform its own speech acts effectively
- Create systems that can make appropriate commitments and promises
- Implement AI that can give clear directives and requests
- Design AI that can express appropriate emotional and social responses

## ðŸ’¡ **Key Takeaways**

**Action-Oriented Language**: Users often use language to accomplish goals, not just share information.

**Intent Recognition**: AI needs to understand what users are trying to accomplish with their words.

**Appropriate Responses**: Different speech acts require different types of responses.

**Context Sensitivity**: The same words can perform different speech acts in different contexts.

**Cultural Awareness**: Speech act conventions vary across cultures and contexts.

**Sequence Completion**: Speech acts often occur in sequences that need to be completed appropriately.

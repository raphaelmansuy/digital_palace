# ‚ö° The 10-10-10 Rule

> **Evaluate decisions by considering their impact across three time horizons**

---

## üéØ **What It Is**

The 10-10-10 Rule is a mental model for making better decisions by systematically considering how you'll feel about a choice across three different time horizons: 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. This helps balance immediate needs with long-term consequences and provides perspective on the true importance of decisions.

**Core Insight**: Decisions that look good in all three time horizons are usually the right choice. Most bad decisions optimize for only one time horizon.

## üß† **The Science**

Based on temporal decision-making research and behavioral economics:
- **Present bias** causes us to overweight immediate rewards vs future benefits
- **Temporal discounting** makes future consequences feel less important than they are
- **Perspective taking** across time horizons reduces emotional decision-making
- **Structured frameworks** improve decision quality by reducing cognitive biases

## ‚è∞ **The Three Time Horizons**

### **‚ö° 10 Minutes (Immediate Impact)**
**Focus:** Urgency, stress, immediate consequences
```
Critical Questions:
- How will I feel about this decision right now?
- What are the immediate consequences and effort required?
- What's the emotional/stress impact today?
- How does this affect my current urgent priorities?
- What's the immediate reaction from stakeholders?
```
**Common traps:** Panic decisions, avoiding difficult conversations, quick fixes

### **üìÖ 10 Months (Medium-term Consequences)**
**Focus:** Skills, relationships, project outcomes, career development
```
Strategic Questions:
- Will this decision matter in 10 months?
- How will this affect my goals for this year/quarter?
- What skills, relationships, or reputation will this build or damage?
- How will this impact ongoing projects and team dynamics?
- What precedent does this set for similar future decisions?
```
**Sweet spot:** Often the most ignored but most important timeframe

### **üîÆ 10 Years (Long-term Implications)**
**Focus:** Legacy, vision alignment, fundamental principles
```
Legacy Questions:
- Will I remember this decision in 10 years?
- How does this align with my long-term vision and values?
- What kind of person/professional does this help me become?
- How will this contribute to my lasting impact and legacy?
- What would 10-years-older me advise about this choice?
```
**Common traps:** Over-optimizing for uncertain futures, analysis paralysis

10 Months: 25% weight
10 Years: 5% weight
```

#### **Strategic Decisions**
```
10 Minutes: 10% weight
10 Months: 30% weight
10 Years: 60% weight (long-term focus)
```

#### **Operational Decisions**
```
10 Minutes: 40% weight
10 Months: 50% weight
10 Years: 10% weight
```

### **Personal Decision Weighting**
```python
def get_personal_weights(decision_context):
    if decision_context.is_early_career():
        return {"immediate": 0.3, "medium": 0.5, "long_term": 0.2}
    elif decision_context.is_mid_career():
        return {"immediate": 0.2, "medium": 0.4, "long_term": 0.4}
    elif decision_context.is_senior_leader():
        return {"immediate": 0.1, "medium": 0.3, "long_term": 0.6}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Common Patterns and Pitfalls**

### **üéØ Immediate Bias**
```
Problem: Overweighting immediate concerns
Solution: Force consideration of long-term impact
Example: Choosing quick fixes over sustainable solutions
```

### **üîÆ Long-term Paralysis**
```
Problem: Over-analyzing long-term consequences for small decisions
Solution: Match analysis depth to decision importance
Example: Spending hours on tool choice for 1-week project
```

### **üìÖ Medium-term Blind Spot**
```
Problem: Focusing only on immediate and long-term
Solution: Explicitly consider medium-term consequences
Example: Ignoring 6-month project impact while optimizing for today and 5 years
```

## üéØ **Advanced Applications**

### **üîÑ Portfolio Decision Making**
Apply 10-10-10 to a portfolio of decisions:
```
Immediate portfolio: 20% of decisions optimized for immediate impact
Medium portfolio: 50% of decisions optimized for medium-term
Long-term portfolio: 30% of decisions optimized for long-term impact
```

### **üìä Team Decision Framework**
```python
def team_10_10_10_analysis(team_members, decision):
    perspectives = {}
    
    for member in team_members:
        perspectives[member.role] = {
            "10_minutes": member.assess_immediate(decision),
            "10_months": member.assess_medium_term(decision),
            "10_years": member.assess_long_term(decision)
        }
    
    return synthesize_team_perspective(perspectives)
```

### **üéØ Decision Reversal Test**
```
Question: If I knew in 10 years that this decision was wrong, what would I wish I had considered?

Use this to identify blind spots in current analysis
```

## üìà **Measuring Decision Quality**

### **üîÑ Decision Tracking**
```python
def track_decision_outcomes(decision_log):
    for decision in decision_log:
        actual_outcomes = measure_outcomes(decision, current_time)
        predicted_outcomes = decision.original_analysis
        
        accuracy = compare_predictions(actual_outcomes, predicted_outcomes)
        update_decision_making_model(accuracy)
```

### **üìä Time Horizon Accuracy**
```
Track which time horizon predictions are most accurate:
- Immediate predictions: Usually accurate (90%+)
- Medium-term predictions: Moderately accurate (60-70%)
- Long-term predictions: Often inaccurate (30-50%)

Adjust confidence and weighting accordingly
```

## üí° **Key Takeaways**

### **üéØ The 10-10-10 Mindset**
- **Most good decisions look good across all three time horizons** - avoid optimizing for just one
- **The medium-term (10 months) is usually most neglected** but often most important for success
- **Immediate decisions often feel most urgent** but long-term consequences matter more
- **Use time horizons to break emotional attachment** to decisions and see clearly

### **üß† Mental Model in Action**
- **Before deciding**: Force yourself to consider all three time horizons explicitly
- **When rushed**: Remember that most "urgent" decisions aren't actually time-sensitive
- **When conflicted**: Look for solutions that work across multiple time horizons
- **When reviewing**: Track which time horizon predictions were most accurate

### **‚ö° Quick Decision Framework**
1. **10 Minutes:** What are the immediate consequences and effort?
2. **10 Months:** How does this affect my main goals and relationships?
3. **10 Years:** Does this align with my values and long-term vision?
4. **Synthesis:** Find options that work well across multiple horizons

### **üåü Success Patterns**
- **Best decisions often require short-term sacrifice** for medium and long-term gains
- **Consistent decision-making across time horizons** builds reputation and compound benefits
- **Different decision types** should weight time horizons differently
- **Regular decision reviews** improve future decision-making calibration

### **üö® Warning Signs**
- **Only considering immediate impact** during crisis or pressure situations
- **Analysis paralysis** when over-analyzing small decisions with 10-year implications
- **Ignoring medium-term** consequences while focusing on immediate and long-term
- **False precision** in predicting exact outcomes rather than directional impact
- **Avoiding difficult decisions** by claiming you need more long-term perspective

### **üéØ Time Horizon Weighting Guidelines**

| **Decision Type** | **10 Min** | **10 Month** | **10 Year** | **Example** |
|-------------------|------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Crisis Response** | 70% | 25% | 5% | Production outage, security breach |
| **Strategic Planning** | 10% | 30% | 60% | Technology platform, team structure |
| **Daily Operations** | 40% | 50% | 10% | Feature priorities, code reviews |
| **Career Moves** | 20% | 40% | 40% | Job changes, skill development |
| **Investment Decisions** | 15% | 35% | 50% | Tool purchases, team expansion |

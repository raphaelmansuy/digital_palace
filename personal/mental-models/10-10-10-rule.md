# ⚡ The 10-10-10 Rule

> **Evaluate decisions by considering their impact across three time horizons**

## 🎯 **What It Is**

The 10-10-10 Rule is a mental model for making better decisions by systematically considering how you'll feel about a choice across three different time horizons: 10 minutes, 10 months, and 10 years. This helps balance immediate needs with long-term consequences and provides perspective on the true importance of decisions.

## ⏰ **The Three Time Horizons**

### **⚡ 10 Minutes (Immediate Impact)**
```
Questions to Ask:
- How will I feel about this decision right now?
- What are the immediate consequences?
- What's the emotional/stress impact today?
- How does this affect my current priorities?
```

### **📅 10 Months (Medium-term Consequences)**
```
Questions to Ask:
- Will this decision matter in 10 months?
- How will this affect my goals for this year?
- What skills/relationships will this build or damage?
- How will this impact my career/projects?
```

### **🔮 10 Years (Long-term Implications)**
```
Questions to Ask:
- Will I remember this decision in 10 years?
- How does this align with my long-term vision?
- What precedent does this set for future decisions?
- How will this contribute to my legacy/impact?
```

## 🎯 **When to Use**

### **🚀 Career Decisions**
- Choosing between job opportunities
- Deciding whether to learn new technologies
- Balancing technical debt vs new features

### **📊 Product Strategy**
- Feature prioritization decisions
- Technology stack choices
- User experience trade-offs

### **💼 Business Decisions**
- Investment allocation choices
- Partnership opportunities
- Risk management decisions

## 🚀 **Practical Applications**

### **Example: AI Model Selection Decision**

**Decision:** Should we use GPT-4 (expensive, powerful) or GPT-3.5 (cheaper, less capable)?

**⚡ 10 Minutes Analysis:**
```
Immediate Impact:
- GPT-4: Higher immediate costs, setup complexity
- GPT-3.5: Quick deployment, budget-friendly
- Emotional state: Pressure to ship quickly
- Current priority: Get MVP to market

Initial preference: GPT-3.5 (speed and cost)
```

**📅 10 Months Analysis:**
```
Medium-term Consequences:
- GPT-4: Better user experience, fewer support issues, easier to add features
- GPT-3.5: May need migration later, potential user satisfaction issues
- Career impact: GPT-4 choice shows strategic thinking
- Project success: User satisfaction crucial for retention

Preference shifting: GPT-4 (long-term user value)
```

**🔮 10 Years Analysis:**
```
Long-term Implications:
- GPT-4: Establishes pattern of quality-first decisions
- GPT-3.5: May regret cutting corners if product fails due to UX
- Legacy: Want to be known for building quality products
- Industry trends: AI quality becomes increasingly important

Final preference: GPT-4 (aligns with long-term values)
```

### **Example: Technical Debt vs New Features**

**Decision:** Should we spend the sprint fixing technical debt or building the requested new feature?

**⚡ 10 Minutes Analysis:**
```
Immediate pressures:
- Stakeholders want new feature
- Technical debt is invisible to users
- Team morale: debt work feels less rewarding
- Time pressure: Feature has deadline

Initial inclination: Build new feature
```

**📅 10 Months Analysis:**
```
Medium-term impact:
- Technical debt: Will slow down all future development
- New feature: Might not be used if system becomes unreliable
- Team productivity: Debt makes everything harder
- Product quality: Technical issues hurt user experience

Leaning toward: Technical debt work
```

**🔮 10 Years Analysis:**
```
Long-term consequences:
- Technical debt: Could make system unmaintainable
- Decision precedent: Always choosing features over foundation
- Career/skills: Building sustainable systems
- Company culture: Establishing quality standards

Clear choice: Technical debt work
```

## 🔧 **Implementation Framework**

### **Step 1: Decision Framing**
```python
def frame_decision(decision_options):
    return {
        "decision": describe_choice_clearly(),
        "options": list_all_viable_alternatives(),
        "stakeholders": identify_affected_parties(),
        "constraints": list_real_constraints()
    }
```

### **Step 2: Time Horizon Analysis**
```python
def analyze_time_horizons(decision, options):
    analysis = {}
    
    for option in options:
        analysis[option] = {
            "10_minutes": evaluate_immediate_impact(option),
            "10_months": evaluate_medium_term(option), 
            "10_years": evaluate_long_term(option)
        }
    
    return analysis
```

### **Step 3: Weighted Decision**
```python
def make_weighted_decision(analysis, time_weights):
    scores = {}
    
    for option, impacts in analysis.items():
        score = (
            impacts["10_minutes"] * time_weights["immediate"] +
            impacts["10_months"] * time_weights["medium"] +
            impacts["10_years"] * time_weights["long_term"]
        )
        scores[option] = score
    
    return max(scores, key=scores.get)
```

## 📊 **Decision Templates**

### Decision: [Chosen option and reasoning]
```

### **🚀 Feature Development Decisions**
```markdown
## Feature Priority Decision

```

## ⚖️ **Time Horizon Weighting**

### **Decision-Type Specific Weights**

#### **Crisis Decisions**
```
10 Minutes: 70% weight (immediate action needed)
10 Months: 25% weight
10 Years: 5% weight
```

#### **Strategic Decisions**
```
10 Minutes: 10% weight
10 Months: 30% weight
10 Years: 60% weight (long-term focus)
```

#### **Operational Decisions**
```
10 Minutes: 40% weight
10 Months: 50% weight
10 Years: 10% weight
```

### **Personal Decision Weighting**
```python
def get_personal_weights(decision_context):
    if decision_context.is_early_career():
        return {"immediate": 0.3, "medium": 0.5, "long_term": 0.2}
    elif decision_context.is_mid_career():
        return {"immediate": 0.2, "medium": 0.4, "long_term": 0.4}
    elif decision_context.is_senior_leader():
        return {"immediate": 0.1, "medium": 0.3, "long_term": 0.6}
```

## ⚠️ **Common Patterns and Pitfalls**

### **🎯 Immediate Bias**
```
Problem: Overweighting immediate concerns
Solution: Force consideration of long-term impact
Example: Choosing quick fixes over sustainable solutions
```

### **🔮 Long-term Paralysis**
```
Problem: Over-analyzing long-term consequences for small decisions
Solution: Match analysis depth to decision importance
Example: Spending hours on tool choice for 1-week project
```

### **📅 Medium-term Blind Spot**
```
Problem: Focusing only on immediate and long-term
Solution: Explicitly consider medium-term consequences
Example: Ignoring 6-month project impact while optimizing for today and 5 years
```

## 🎯 **Advanced Applications**

### **🔄 Portfolio Decision Making**
Apply 10-10-10 to a portfolio of decisions:
```
Immediate portfolio: 20% of decisions optimized for immediate impact
Medium portfolio: 50% of decisions optimized for medium-term
Long-term portfolio: 30% of decisions optimized for long-term impact
```

### **📊 Team Decision Framework**
```python
def team_10_10_10_analysis(team_members, decision):
    perspectives = {}
    
    for member in team_members:
        perspectives[member.role] = {
            "10_minutes": member.assess_immediate(decision),
            "10_months": member.assess_medium_term(decision),
            "10_years": member.assess_long_term(decision)
        }
    
    return synthesize_team_perspective(perspectives)
```

### **🎯 Decision Reversal Test**
```
Question: If I knew in 10 years that this decision was wrong, what would I wish I had considered?

Use this to identify blind spots in current analysis
```

## 📈 **Measuring Decision Quality**

### **🔄 Decision Tracking**
```python
def track_decision_outcomes(decision_log):
    for decision in decision_log:
        actual_outcomes = measure_outcomes(decision, current_time)
        predicted_outcomes = decision.original_analysis
        
        accuracy = compare_predictions(actual_outcomes, predicted_outcomes)
        update_decision_making_model(accuracy)
```

### **📊 Time Horizon Accuracy**
```
Track which time horizon predictions are most accurate:
- Immediate predictions: Usually accurate (90%+)
- Medium-term predictions: Moderately accurate (60-70%)
- Long-term predictions: Often inaccurate (30-50%)

Adjust confidence and weighting accordingly
```

## 💡 **Key Takeaways**

- **Consider immediate, medium-term, and long-term impacts for important decisions**
- **Weight time horizons based on decision type and personal situation**
- **Use structured templates to ensure consistent analysis**
- **Don't over-analyze small decisions, but don't under-analyze big ones**

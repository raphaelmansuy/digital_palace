# ðŸ”„ Double-Loop Learning

## What It Is
A learning process where individuals or organizations question and modify underlying assumptions, not just actions. Contrasts with single-loop learning, which only corrects errors within existing frameworks.

## The Science
Developed by Chris Argyris, double-loop learning is supported by research in organizational psychology and systems thinking. It leads to deeper, more adaptive change.

## When to Use
- When repeated problems persist despite fixes
- During retrospectives or post-mortems
- To foster innovation and adaptability

## Applications in AI
- Improving model performance by questioning data or objectives
- Revising project goals based on real-world feedback
- Encouraging teams to challenge "the way we've always done it"

## Patterns
- Single-loop: "Are we doing things right?"
- Double-loop: "Are we doing the right things?"

## Strategies
- Regularly review assumptions and mental models
- Create safe spaces for questioning and experimentation
- Document changes in both actions and beliefs

## Pitfalls
- Can be uncomfortable or threatening to established norms
- May slow progress if overused
- Requires psychological safety and trust

## Measurement
- Track frequency and impact of assumption changes
- Monitor innovation and adaptability metrics
- Survey team for openness to questioning

## Takeaways
Double-loop learning enables AI teams to adapt at a deeper level, not just fix surface issues. Use it to drive continuous improvement and resilience in complex environments.

# ðŸªž Socratic Questioning

## What It Is
A disciplined method of asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking, clarify concepts, and uncover underlying assumptions. Named after Socrates, it is foundational in philosophy and education.

## The Science
Socratic questioning leverages metacognition and cognitive psychology, encouraging deeper processing and reflection. Studies show it improves reasoning, learning, and problem-solving by exposing gaps in knowledge and logic.

## When to Use
- When facing ambiguous or complex AI decisions
- To clarify requirements, goals, or assumptions
- During team discussions to surface hidden biases

## Applications in AI
- Requirements gathering: Ensure all stakeholders understand the problem
- Model evaluation: Challenge assumptions about data, metrics, or outcomes
- Debugging: Uncover root causes by questioning each step
- Ethics reviews: Probe for unintended consequences or overlooked risks

## Patterns
- Open-ended questions: "What evidence supports this?"
- Probing assumptions: "Why do we believe this is true?"
- Exploring alternatives: "What else could explain this?"
- Examining implications: "If we do this, what might happen?"

## Strategies
- Use a sequence of questions to peel back layers of reasoning
- Encourage all team members to participate
- Document questions and answers for transparency

## Pitfalls
- Can be perceived as confrontational if not done respectfully
- May slow down decision-making if overused
- Risk of analysis paralysis if questions never lead to action

## Measurement
- Track clarity of requirements and decisions before/after sessions
- Monitor reduction in misunderstandings or rework
- Survey team for perceived value of questioning sessions

## Takeaways
Socratic questioning is a powerful tool for surfacing assumptions, clarifying thinking, and improving AI decisions. Use it to foster a culture of inquiry and continuous improvement.

## üéØ **Decision Scenarios**

### üîß **"My AI System Has Poor Performance"**

**‚ùå Common Approach**: Immediately start fine-tuning the model

**‚úÖ Mental Model Approach**: Use **[Abstraction Ladder](./abstraction-ladder.md)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Poor Performance] --> B{Which Layer?}
    B -->|üé® Application| C[Check user flows, UX design]
    B -->|üîß Framework| D[Review prompts, retrieval logic]
    B -->|üß† Model| E[Evaluate model choice, parameters]
    B -->|‚öôÔ∏è Hardware| F[Check latency, infrastructure]
    
    C --> G[80% of issues found here]
    D --> H[15% of issues found here]
    E --> I[4% of issues found here]
    F --> J[1% of issues found here]
```

**Decision Template**:
1. **Application Layer**: Are users asking answerable questions?
2. **Framework Layer**: Are prompts clear and retrieval working?
3. **Model Layer**: Is the model appropriate for this task?
4. **Hardware Layer**: Is latency affecting experience?

### üèóÔ∏è **"Should We Build, Buy, or Partner for This AI Capability?"**

**Mental Models**: **[Build vs Buy vs Partner](./build-buy-partner-matrix.md)** + **[North Star Principle](./north-star-principle.md)**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[AI Capability Needed] --> B{Strategic Importance?}
    B -->|Core Competitive Edge| C[BUILD]
    B -->|Important but Not Core| D{Time Pressure?}
    B -->|Nice to Have| E[USE EXISTING]
    
    D -->|High| F[BUY]
    D -->|Medium| G{Resource Availability?}
    
    G -->|High Internal Capacity| H[BUILD]
    G -->|Limited Capacity| I[PARTNER]
```

**Decision Framework**:

| Use Case | Priority 1 | Priority 2 | Accept Trade-off | Solution |
|----------|------------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **Core Competitive** | Control | Quality | Higher Cost & Time | Build internally |
| **Time-Critical** | Speed | Quality | Higher Cost | Buy premium solution |

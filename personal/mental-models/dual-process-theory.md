# ðŸ”„ Dual Process Theory

## What It Is
A cognitive science model describing two modes of thinking: fast, intuitive (System 1) and slow, analytical (System 2). In AI, it inspires hybrid systems and user experience design.

## The Science
Supported by decades of research in psychology (notably Daniel Kahneman), dual process theory explains biases, errors, and strengths in human reasoning. It informs AI design for both automation and human-in-the-loop systems.

## When to Use
- Designing AI that interacts with humans
- Building systems that require both speed and accuracy
- Analyzing user errors or decision patterns

## Applications in AI
- Hybrid models: Fast heuristics + slow, accurate algorithms
- User interfaces: Supporting both quick actions and deep analysis
- Error handling: Detecting and correcting intuitive mistakes

## Patterns
- System 1: Fast, automatic, emotional
- System 2: Slow, deliberate, logical

## Strategies
- Design for seamless switching between modes
- Provide explanations and transparency for complex decisions
- Use defaults and nudges for routine tasks

## Pitfalls
- Overreliance on either mode can cause errors
- Users may resist switching between modes
- Complexity in implementation and user training

## Measurement
- Track error rates and decision times
- Monitor user satisfaction and trust
- Analyze usage patterns for mode switching

## Takeaways
Dual Process Theory helps AI teams design systems that balance speed and accuracy, automation and oversight. Use it to build more intuitive, reliable, and user-friendly AI.

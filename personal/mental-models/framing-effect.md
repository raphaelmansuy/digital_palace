# ðŸ§­ Framing Effect

## What It Is
A cognitive bias where people react differently depending on how information is presented, rather than just the information itself. In AI, it affects user decisions, trust, and engagement.

## The Science
Rooted in behavioral economics and psychology, the framing effect is well-documented in decision science. It influences risk perception, choices, and user experience.

## When to Use
- Designing user interfaces or AI explanations
- Communicating AI results or recommendations
- A/B testing different presentations of the same data

## Applications in AI
- Prompt design: How you ask a question changes the answer
- User onboarding: Framing features to encourage adoption
- Risk communication: Presenting probabilities or uncertainties

## Patterns
- Positive vs. negative framing (e.g., "90% success" vs. "10% failure")
- Default options and anchoring

## Strategies
- Test multiple framings for key messages
- Use clear, neutral language for critical decisions
- Be transparent about uncertainties and trade-offs

## Pitfalls
- Manipulative framing can erode trust
- Inconsistent framing confuses users
- Overemphasis on framing may distract from substance

## Measurement
- Track user choices and engagement across different framings
- Monitor trust and satisfaction metrics
- Analyze decision quality and error rates

## Takeaways
The Framing Effect reminds AI teams that how you present information matters as much as what you present. Use it ethically to improve clarity, trust, and user outcomes.

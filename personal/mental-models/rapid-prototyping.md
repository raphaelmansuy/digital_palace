# ðŸ”„ Rapid Prototyping

## What It Is
A design thinking approach focused on quickly building and testing simple versions of a product or feature to gather feedback and iterate rapidly.

## The Science
Rapid prototyping is supported by research in innovation, product development, and learning theory. It reduces risk, accelerates learning, and improves product-market fit.

## When to Use
- Early in AI product or feature development
- When uncertainty or risk is high
- To validate ideas before full investment

## Applications in AI
- Testing new model architectures or features
- Gathering user feedback on interface designs
- Iterating on prompts or workflows

## Patterns
- Build â†’ Test â†’ Learn â†’ Iterate
- Use low-fidelity prototypes (sketches, mockups) before high-fidelity

## Strategies
- Set clear learning goals for each prototype
- Involve users early and often
- Embrace failure as a source of insight

## Pitfalls
- Skipping validation steps or ignoring feedback
- Overinvesting in prototypes before validation
- Confusing prototypes with final products

## Measurement
- Track iteration speed and learning cycles
- Monitor user feedback and engagement
- Measure reduction in development risk and cost

## Takeaways
Rapid Prototyping helps AI teams learn fast, reduce risk, and build better products. Use it to validate ideas early and adapt quickly to real-world needs.

# üìù Today I Learned (TIL) - Personal Knowledge Base

> Daily discoveries and insights in AI development

## üéØ Purpose

The goal of this TIL collection is to document and reflect upon something new or interesting learned each day. It serves as a personal knowledge base where I can record and reflect on daily learning experiences in AI, programming, and technology.

## üìö Recent Entries

### 2024-12

#### [2024-12-29: Effective Prompt Caching Strategies](./2024/2024-12-29-prompt-caching.md)
Learned about different approaches to cache LLM prompts and responses for better performance. Key insight: semantic similarity caching works better than exact string matching.

#### [2024-12-28: Vector Database Performance Optimization](./2024/2024-12-28-vector-db-optimization.md) 
Discovered that using approximate nearest neighbor search with proper indexing can reduce query time by 80% while maintaining 95% accuracy.

#### [2024-12-27: Fine-tuning with QLoRA](./2024/2024-12-27-qlora-finetuning.md)
Successfully fine-tuned Llama 3.2 using QLoRA with only 8GB VRAM. The key was proper gradient accumulation and learning rate scheduling.

### 2024-11

#### [2024-11-25: Multi-modal RAG with Images](./2024/2024-11-25-multimodal-rag.md)
Implemented a RAG system that works with both text and images using CLIP embeddings. Game-changer for document processing with diagrams.

#### [2024-11-20: LangGraph for Complex Workflows](./2024/2024-11-20-langgraph-workflows.md)
LangGraph provides a much cleaner way to handle complex AI agent workflows compared to traditional chains. The state management is excellent.

A hands-on, step-by-step guide by Thorsten Ball (April 2025) for building a fully functioning, code-editing agent in Go using the Anthropic API. This tutorial covers:

- Setting up a Go project for agent development
- Implementing a conversational loop with Claude
- Adding tool use (read_file, list_files, edit_file) for real-world agentic workflows
- Practical code examples and explanations
- How LLMs use tools and maintain context

**Why it matters:**
- Shows how little code is needed to build a powerful agent
- Demonstrates best practices for tool use and agent design
- Great for developers, researchers, and anyone interested in LLM-powered automation

**Source:** [GitHub - davidkimai](https://github.com/davidkimai/Context-Engineering)

**Description:**
A comprehensive, frontier handbook for moving beyond prompt engineering to context design, orchestration, and optimization. Inspired by Andrej Karpathy's definition of context engineering, this repository provides progressive learning from first principles to advanced neural field theory. Features hands-on tutorials, reusable templates, practical examples, and research evidence from IBM, MIT, Princeton, and other top institutions. With 2.4k stars and active development, this is the definitive resource for understanding context engineering in modern AI systems. Perfect for developers, researchers, and practitioners building production-ready AI agents.

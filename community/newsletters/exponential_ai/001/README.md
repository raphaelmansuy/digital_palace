# Exponential AI - New Developments Each Week

## Introduction and Mission

Welcome to Exponential AI, a weekly newsletter covering the latest developments in artificial intelligence.

 I started this newsletter to share my knowledge and insights on the rapid advances happening in AI.

 We are truly living in the most exciting time for AI, with new breakthroughs being made every week that have the potential to transform industries and our daily lives.

However, with the accelerated pace of AI development, even for professionals like myself it can be challenging to keep up with all the latest news and research.

 My goal is to cut through the noise and highlight the most important AI advances and implications for both business leaders and technology practitioners.

Each week, I carefully curate a selection of what I consider to be the top AI news stories and developments.

 My focus is on real-world impacts of AI that business executives need to understand, as well as technical achievements that are pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

 I provide context and analysis to translate complex AI topics into strategic insights, while also sharing the latest research papers and startup funding news relevant to enterprise AI adoption.

For AI developers and engineers, I showcase new tools, frameworks, and best practices that can help them build better AI systems.

I make connections between the latest academic research and how those methods can be applied to create business value.

With the newsletter, practitioners can stay up-to-date on the state-of-the-art in AI and get inspired by new techniques.

In launching this publication, my mission is to filter through the hype and surface the AI advancements that truly matter right now.

The acceleration of AI requires an expert guide to identify the most meaningful developments amidst the sea of news.

With over two decades of experience applying AI across industries, I provide the knowledge and foresight that readers need to navigate the AI landscape and prepare for its impacts.

My hope is this newsletter becomes an indispensable AI resource for leaders and innovators alike.

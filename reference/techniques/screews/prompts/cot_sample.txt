Question: Julie is reading a 120-page book. Yesterday, she was able to read 12 pages and today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. If she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, how many pages should she read?
Answer: Maila read 12 x 2 = <<12*2=24>>24 pages today.\nSo she was able to read a total of 12 + 24 = <<12+24=36>>36 pages since yesterday.\nThere are 120 - 36 = <<120-36=84>>84 pages left to be read.\nSince she wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow, then she should read 84/2 = <<84/2=42>>42 pages. The answer is 42
Question: The profit from a business transaction is shared among 2 business partners, Mike and Johnson in the ratio 2:5 respectively. If Johnson got $2500, how much will Mike have after spending some of his share on a shirt that costs $200?
Answer: According to the ratio, for every 5 parts that Johnson gets, Mike gets 2 parts\nSince Johnson got $2500, each part is therefore $2500/5 = $<<2500/5=500>>500\nMike will get 2*$500 = $<<2*500=1000>>1000\nAfter buying the shirt he will have $1000-$200 = $<<1000-200=800>>800 left. The answer is 800
Question: Ralph is going to practice playing tennis with a tennis ball machine that shoots out tennis balls for Ralph to hit. He loads up the machine with 175 tennis balls to start with. Out of the first 100 balls, he manages to hit 2/5 of them. Of the next 75 tennis balls, he manages to hit 1/3 of them. Out of all the tennis balls, how many did Ralph not hit?
Answer: Out of the first 100 balls, Ralph was able to hit 2/5 of them and not able to hit 3/5 of them, 3/5 x 100 = 60 tennis balls Ralph didn't hit.\nOut of the next 75 balls, Ralph was able to hit 1/3 of them and not able to hit 2/3 of them, 2/3 x 75 = 50 tennis balls that Ralph didn't hit.\nCombined, Ralph was not able to hit 60 + 50 = <<60+50=110>>110 tennis balls Ralph didn't hit. The answer is 110

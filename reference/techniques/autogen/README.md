    C[Images] -->|Analyze| B
    D[Sensor Data] -->|Interpret| B
    E[API Responses] -->|Parse| B
    B --> F[Environmental Understanding]
```

#### 🧠 Reasoning  
Agents make intelligent decisions using AI techniques:

    B --> D[Machine Learning Models]
    B --> E[Rule-based Logic]
    C --> F[Intelligent Decision]
    D --> F
    E --> F
```

#### 💬 Interaction
Agents communicate naturally with users and other systems:

```mermaid

3. **Human Proxy**: Integration point for human oversight
4. **Code Execution**: Safe environment for running generated code
5. **Workflow Management**: Orchestration of agent interactions

---

## 💡 Quick Start Example

### Simple Two-Agent Collaboration

Let's create a basic AutoGen setup with a planner and coder working together:

```python
import autogen

# Configure LLM settings
config_list = [
    {
        "model": "gpt-4",
        "api_key": "your-openai-key"
    }
]

# Create a planning agent
planner = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="planner",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    system_message="You are a planning expert. Break down complex tasks into clear, actionable steps."
)

# Create a coding agent  
coder = autogen.AssistantAgent(
    name="coder",
    llm_config={"config_list": config_list},
    system_message="You are a coding expert. Write clean, efficient code based on the provided plan."
)

# Create a human proxy for oversight
user_proxy = autogen.UserProxyAgent(
    name="user_proxy",
    human_input_mode="TERMINATE",
    code_execution_config={"work_dir": "coding"}
)

# Start the collaboration
user_proxy.initiate_chat(
    planner,
    message="Create a web scraper that extracts product prices from an e-commerce site"
)
```

### Expected Output Flow

1. **Planner** analyzes the request and creates a detailed plan
2. **Coder** receives the plan and writes implementation code
3. **User Proxy** executes and validates the code
4. **Iteration** continues until the solution is complete

- **Safety:** Ensuring agents behave reliably and do not cause harm, even in unfamiliar scenarios. Testing and validation is critical.

- **Explainability:** Understanding the rationale behind agent decisions, especially those made by black box ML models underlying agents.

By leveraging different architectures, AI agents can be highly effective for complex real-world tasks across many industries. But designing agents to be scalable, safe, and explainable remains an active area of research.

## Introducing Microsoft AutoGen

[AutoGen](https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) is an open-source Python framework from Microsoft Research for building AI agent systems using large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4.

[AutoGen: Enabling Next-Gen LLM Applications via Multi-Agent Conversation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08155)

AutoGen provides tools to simplify the orchestration, optimization, and automation of workflows involving LLMs. It lets you combine the strengths of different AI techniques into capable, conversational agents.

With AutoGen, you can:

- **Customize Agents:** Configure agents with different capabilities powered by LLMs, humans, tools or a mix.

- **Automate Conversations:** Orchestrate complex conversations between agents to solve tasks.

- **Optimize Workflows:** Automate and enhance workflows by integrating LLMs.

AutoGen makes agent development modular and intuitive. You just define a set of agents and their interaction behaviors. This simplifies creating reusable, composable agents.

## Building an AI Agent with AutoGen

Let's walk through a hands-on tutorial to build a simple AI agent with AutoGen.

We will create an agent to answer natural language questions about Python code. Our agent will leverage an LLM for answering, execute code safely, and clarify ambiguous questions.

### 1. Install AutoGen

First, install the AutoGen package:

```
pip install pyautogen
```

Import the modules:

```python
import autogen
from autogen import Agent, Message
```

### 2. Define Agents

We will define 3 agents for our system:

- **User:** Simulates user interactions
- **Assistant:** Answers code questions using an LLM
- **Executor:** Safely executes Python code

```python
user = Agent("User")
assistant = Agent("Assistant")
executor = Agent("Executor")
```

We initialize the assistant agent with a language model. AutoGen supports any OpenAI API key for this.

```python
assistant.init_openai(openai_api_key="sk-...") 
```

### 3. Implement Agent Behaviors

Next, we define how each agent behaves by implementing `process` methods:

```python
def user_process(self, message: Message):
  # Simulates user questions
  return Message(f"What does this Python code do: {message.content}")

def assistant_process(self, message: Message):
  # Uses LLM to answer code questions
  prompt = f"{message.content}\n\nHere is a plain language explanation:"
  response = openai.Completion.create(prompt=prompt, model="text-davinci-003")
  return Message(response["choices"][0]["text"])  

def executor_process(self, message: Message):
  # Executes Python code safely
  try:
    exec(message.content)
  except:
    return Message("Sorry, I couldn't execute that code safely.")
  
  return Message("Code executed successfully!")
```

We override the default `process` method for each agent class:

```python
user.process = user_process
assistant.process = assistant_process 
executor.process = executor_process
```

### 4. Run the Conversation

We can now start a conversation between the user and assistant:

```python
user.send_message_to(assistant, Message("What does this Python code do: print('Hello World!')"))
```

This will call the `user_process` and `assistant_process` methods to generate responses.

We can integrate the executor agent when code execution is needed:

```python
user.send_message_to(assistant, Message("What does this code do: import math; print(math.factorial(5))"))

assistant.send_message_to(executor, Message("import math; print(math.factorial(5))"))
# Executor runs code and replies safely

assistant.send_reply_to(user, executor.latest_response) 
# Assistant relays executor output to user
```

AutoGen handles routing messages between agents and orchestrating the conversation flow.

### 5. Run Automated Conversations

We can also let AutoGen automatically mediate a complete conversation using:

```python
autogen.run_agent_conversation(agents=[user, assistant, executor],
                               initiator=user,
                               initial_message="What does this code do: print('Hello World!')")
```

This will run a full back-and-forth conversation between the agents to resolve the user's question.

AutoGen supports many patterns like group chats, loops, conditionals to orchestrate complex conversations.

## Key Takeaways

- AutoGen simplifies building AI agents by handling coordination between modular, reusable skills.

- It automates conversations between agents to solve ambiguous, complex tasks.

- AutoGen integrates the strengths of LLMs, humans, and tools into capable agents.

- The framework is highly customizable for diverse use cases and provides many optimization features.

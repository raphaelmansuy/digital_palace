# Meet Your New AI Business Advisors â€¦

## Introduction

As a manager of a small business, you may often feel disadvantaged compared to Fortune 500 CEOs. Large corporations have dedicated departments for legal, HR, supply chain, and technology, while small businesses usually rely on a few generalist employees or external consultants.

The good news is that AI is starting to level the playing field. While AI cannot fully replicate the expertise of humans, it can provide many benefits of specialist advisors at a lower cost.

For instance, HR chatbots can offer basic guidance on policies, compliance, and best practices. Contract review AI can scan agreements to identify important clauses and risks. Inventory management AI can optimize ordering and supply chains. Customer service chatbots can handle common requests and questions.

The key advantage of AI is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and past experiences to provide useful recommendations and insights. Although AI lacks the deep understanding of the best human experts, it can offer advice comparable to good professionals in many situations.

However, AI does have limitations. It excels in structured and routine tasks but struggles with novel and complex situations that involve ambiguity. Human judgment remains essential in areas like compliance, legal issues, and strategic advice where qualified lawyers and human consultants are indispensable.

Nevertheless, AI can provide small businesses with valuable expertise at an affordable price point for many day-to-day issues. When used as a supplemental advisor, AI can enable small businesses to access specialized knowledge without incurring excessive costs. It empowers small teams to make informed decisions across various aspects of their business.

Introducing "The Board of Advisors," a technique that brings AI-powered advisory services to small businesses through the use of large language models.

## How is it possible ?

Thanks to the advancements in large language models, we can now recreate the expertise of a board of experts. 

These models are trained on vast amounts of data, allowing them to understand and generate human-like text in various domains. 

By utilizing these models, we can simulate the knowledge and insights that would typically come from a board of experts. 

This enables us to provide valuable advisory services to small businesses, leveling the playing field and empowering them with the expertise they need to make informed decisions.

### A board of experts

**For example you can create the following board of experts:**

- **Industry Veteran:** An experienced professional with a deep understanding of the company's specific industry, market trends, and competitive landscape.
- **Financial Expert:** A certified accountant or financial analyst who can provide guidance on financial strategies, risk management, and investment decisions.
- **Legal Counsel:** A seasoned attorney specializing in corporate law, contracts, and regulatory compliance to ensure the company operates within the bounds of the law.
- **Technology Guru:** An expert in emerging technologies and digital trends who can advise on IT strategies, cybersecurity, and digital transformation.
- **Marketing Maven:** A marketing strategist with expertise in brand management, customer acquisition, and market positioning.
- **Human Resources Specialist:** An HR professional who can provide insights into talent management, recruitment, employee engagement, and organizational development.
- **Supply Chain and Operations Expert:** Someone well-versed in supply chain management, logistics, and operations efficiency to optimize processes and reduce costs.
- **Environmental and Sustainability Advisor:** An expert in sustainability practices and environmental impact assessment to help the company adopt eco-friendly and socially responsible policies.
- **Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) Specialist:** A seasoned professional who can guide the company through mergers, acquisitions, and strategic partnerships.
- **Customer Experience Strategist:** An expert in customer satisfaction and user experience design, ensuring the company delivers products and services that meet customer expectations.

These experts come equipped with the best knowledge in their respective fields. To ensure they stay up-to-date and well-informed, each of them has chosen the best books available in their areas of expertise. They constantly expand their knowledge by studying the latest research, industry publications, and thought-provoking literature.

### Result

<aside>
ðŸ“” Here are detailed recommendations from the Board of experts on strategies to expand your client base, increase revenue, and stay current with Microsoft technologies as a Microsoft consulting firm CEO:

From the Industry Veteran:

Step 1: Focus on disruptive innovations in Microsoft's product lineup to identify new opportunities

- Read "The Innovator's Dilemma" to understand how to spot disruptive innovations that upend markets. Examine Microsoft's emerging products like Azure cloud, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform for disruptive potential.
- Focus on these high-growth areas early on rather than established products to gain a competitive advantage. Ride the wave as these disruptive innovations gain mainstream adoption.

Step 2: Look for "blue ocean" spaces in Microsoft's ecosystem

- Use the "Blue Ocean Strategy" framework to identify uncontested market spaces with low competition in Microsoft's ecosystem. Expand into offering services around new capabilities like AI, IoT, mixed reality that lack specialist firms.
- Don't get caught in the "red ocean" of fighting for share in crowded markets like Office 365 consulting. Create new "blue ocean" space with differentiated offerings.

Step 3: Develop "multiplier" mindset to grow your team

- Apply lessons from "Multipliers" to develop employees into self-sufficient experts. Foster knowledge sharing, autonomy and vertical communication.
- Resist acting as the "genius" with all the answers. Let your team gain expertise through practice, mentoring and access to resources. They will multiply capacity.

From the Financial Expert:

Step 1: Analyze profitability by service line

- Use "Financial Intelligence" techniques like activity-based costing to analyze profit margins for each service offering. Identify your most and least profitable activities.
- Consider pruning low-margin services and doubling down on offerings with higher margins to improve profitability.

Step 2: Assess client lifetime value

- Calculate client lifetime value using revenues, retention rates and customer acquisition cost. Identify your most valuable customers and prioritize expanding your share of their IT spending.
- Take a long-term view of customer relationships, as per "The Intelligent Investor". Maximizing lifetime value is more important than short-term sales.

Step 3: Build scalable revenue through products

- Shift focus from pure consulting to productized services as outlined in "Security Analysis". Products like audits, plans and managed services can scale easier.
- Invest to develop resellable intellectual property like assessment frameworks, playbooks and training programs. Recurring revenue products reduce feast-or-famine cycles.

From the Legal Counsel:

Step 1: Update contracts to limit liability risks

- Review service contracts as per "The Art of Lawyering". Limit liabilities, carve out warranties and include protections like force majeure clauses.
- Shift liability for project failures disproportionately onto clients. Be aggressive in pursuing payments for changes in project scope.

Step 2: Add non-compete clauses to employment contracts

- Bind employees to non-compete agreements as advised in "Contracts: Cases and Doctrine". Prevent them from leaving and taking clients.
- Enforce non-competes to the fullest extent legally possible in your jurisdiction. Aggressively litigate violations.

Step 3: Lock in multi-year subscriptions and renewals

- Structure service deals as multi-year subscriptions with auto-renewals per client advice in "Contracts". Make it harder for clients to defect.
- Build recurring revenue streams to improve financial visibility and limit churn. Structure billing and payment terms favorably.

From the Technology Guru:

Step 1: Build expertise in Azure cloud and Power Platform

- Prioritize building capabilities in Azure and Power Platform per "The Innovator's Dilemma". Cloud and low-code are disruptive innovations gaining mainstream adoption.

Step 2: Adopt agile software development processes

- Implement agile software project management as outlined in "The Lean Startup". Take an iterative approach to build solutions for clients faster.
- Ship minimum viable products early, gather user feedback, continuously improve. Deliver value faster, reduce project risk.

Step 3: Leverage scalable online learning platforms

- Use platforms like LinkedIn Learning, Pluralsight as recommended in "The Lean Startup" to rapidly skill up on new Microsoft capabilities.
- Encourage employees to self-learn. Curation of content matters more than creation. Lower training costs.

From the Marketing Maven:

Step 1: Develop authority marketing positioning

- Establish thought leadership in Microsoft technology per "Influence". Publish content, speak at events, engage influencers to boost authority.
- Don't compete on price. Compete on expertise and insight. Use content to attract high-value clients.

From the Human Resources Specialist:

Step 1: Assess team dynamics

- Diagnose dysfunctions using "The Five Dysfunctions of a Team". Build trust, confront conflicts, enhance commitment and accountability.
- Don't ignore cracks in team cohesion. Nip issues in the bud before they become endemic.

Step 2: Motivate with autonomy and purpose

- Draw lessons from "Drive" on motivation. Give employees autonomy over tasks and tools. Connect work to purpose.
- Maximize internal motivation by enabling mastery and creativity, not control. Purpose and growth matter more than incentives.

Step 3: Develop an "alliance" with employees

- Treat employees like allies, not resources, as per "The Alliance". Invest in their growth and allow flexibility.
- Guide careers, don't dictate. Customize "tours of duty". Build loyalty by enabling advancement inside or outside firm.

From the Supply Chain and Operations Expert:

Step 1: Define and optimize key business processes

- Map core business processes and identify constraints as outlined in "The Goal". Remove roadblocks slowing the pace of business.
- Optimize bottlenecks like sales processing, service delivery and billing. Streamline processes for maximum speed.

Step 2: Implement project management systems

- Introduce systems like Microsoft Project per "Supply Chain Management" to track projects, schedules and utilization. Enhance visibility.
- Minimize work delays. Ensure on-time project delivery. Make sure employees are allocated to highest priorities.

Step 3: Automate tasks for efficiency

- Automate repetitive tasks like reporting, filling, scheduling where possible as highlighted in "Supply Chain Management".
- Save employee time for higher level work. Automate to scale without proportionally growing labor costs.

From the Sustainability Advisor:

Step 1: Assess and reduce business's environmental impact

- Prioritize deals that can expand your client base, enhance capabilities, or enter new geographic markets.

Step 2: Evaluate target firms based on synergies

- Estimate revenue and cost synergies by eliminating redundancies as advised in "The Art of M&A".
- Review past deals in your market using case studies. Acquire strategically aligned capabilities.

Step 3: Integrate cultures post-merger

- Avoid culture clashes by bringing teams together early per "The Art of M&A" integration best practices.
- Align values, institute joint training, share success stories. Blend the best of both firm cultures.

From the Customer Experience Strategist:

Step 1: Build a customer-centric culture

- Foster an obsession with customer experience across your firm as recommended in "Customer Experience 3.0". Reward CX excellence.
- Continuously gather first-hand data through surveys, interviews, and user testing. Eliminate pain points.

Step 2: Leverage data and MarTech tools

- Apply data and tools like CRM, marketing automation per "Customer Experience 3.0" to personalize engagements.

Step 3: Design sticky user onboarding flows

## Step 2: Use a chain to query a list of experts

By asking each expert individually, we can tap into their specific knowledge and worldviews, allowing us to gather more focused and valuable insights. Each expert brings their unique expertise and perspective to the table, which enhances the overall knowledge base and recommendations provided by the system.

This approach enables us to harness the depth of knowledge from each expert in their respective fields. It allows us to dive into specific topics and extract detailed strategies, step-by-step actions, and reasoning behind their recommendations. By combining these individual inputs, we create a more comprehensive and powerful system that covers a wide range of business aspects.

Furthermore, engaging experts one at a time ensures that their advice is given proper attention and consideration. It allows us to thoroughly explore each expert's ideas and recommendations before moving on to the next one. This focused approach ensures that we capture the full value of each expert's insights and avoid diluting their expertise.

Overall, by leveraging the expertise of each individual expert separately, we create a more robust and insightful system that can provide targeted and actionable recommendations across various business areas.

## Step 3: Use a chain to query a list of experts with a fined tuned model

Standard out-of-the-box large language models are generalists, capable of generating text across a wide range of topics.

However, to achieve better results and domain-specific expertise, it is recommended to create fine-tuned models for each area of specialization.

The performance of AI tools relies heavily on the quality and relevance of the training data used to build them. Unlike humans who can rely on years of diverse life experience, AI models are limited to the data they are trained on. If this training data is incomplete, biased, or does not sufficiently represent the intended domain, the AI will have limited capabilities.

For example, a contract review AI trained only on simple non-disclosure agreements may fail to properly analyze the clauses in complex partnership contracts. Similarly, a sales forecasting algorithm will make inaccurate predictions if trained on data that does not capture seasonal fluctuations or macroeconomic factors.

The best practice is to train AI on large, clean datasets that encompass the full scope of expected use cases. This requires investing substantial effort in dataset construction, cleaning, and augmentation. For many business applications, it is essential to partner with domain experts who deeply understand the nuances of the data and can ensure the AI has sufficient high-quality examples to learn from.

Proper training data is the foundation for AI tools to generate reliable insights and recommendations. As such, organizations must prioritize training data quality and use rigorous processes to evaluate if the data truly supports robust AI performance across diverse real-world conditions. With a comprehensive, relevant training dataset, AI tools can effectively distill key patterns and insights to enhance decision making. But without appropriate data, their performance will suffer dramatically.

One way to accomplish this is by using the best book in each field as a reference to fine-tune the corresponding model. This approach, as described in "Textbooks Are All You Need II: phi-1.5 technical report," allows for more accurate and context-aware text generation tailored to the specific expertise of each domain.

## Step 4: Add external source of data

To complement this approach, we can incorporate external sources of data and utilize tools to search through the vast amount of information and documents within the company. By leveraging these additional resources, we can further enhance the knowledge base and provide even more comprehensive and accurate recommendations tailored to specific business needs.

## Limitations

While AI tools can provide valuable insights and efficiency gains, it is important to recognize their limitations in handling ambiguity and complexity. Unlike human experts, AI algorithms rely on recognizing patterns in large datasets. They excel at reaching conclusions based on structured, quantitative data and well-defined problem parameters.

However, many business situations involve significant uncertainty, unknowns, and intangibles that cannot be neatly quantified. Strategic decision making requires deep experience, nuance, and the ability to make subjective judgments based on incomplete information. AI lacks the capacity for sophisticated reasoning that considers contextual factors.

While algorithms can analyze contracts or financials, they cannot replace a seasoned lawyer or financial advisor's wisdom honed over years of practice. Similarly, AI chatbots may handle routine customer queries, but high-value relationships depend on human judgment reading between the lines. Relying solely on AI conclusions without human oversight could lead to oversights, biases, or unintended consequences.

The key is determining the appropriate roles for humans versus AI tools. Algorithms should augment experts, not replace them. By combining AI's scalable data processing with human judgment and accountability, businesses can achieve the best outcomes. But for complex, high-risk decisions, ultimate responsibility should stay with experienced professionals who can apply strategic thinking and wisdom beyond the limits of current AI.

While AI tools offer many benefits, it is important to be aware of the potential downsides of becoming overly dependent on algorithmic systems. A major risk is the loss of human accountability and oversight. If businesses cede too much decision-making power to AI, they may inadvertently promote biases, errors, and unintended consequences. For example, an AI recruitment tool trained on biased data may discount qualified candidates based on gender or ethnicity. Legal contracts and compliance ultimately require human review, as automated systems lack common sense and contextual judgment. As AI advisor tools proliferate across business functions, there is a danger of managers becoming complacent and failing to scrutinize AI recommendations. If the limitations and inner workings of algorithms are not properly understood, managers may follow AI guidance blindly without considering its flaws or alternatives. Overreliance on AI can also erode workforce skills over time if human experts are not kept in the loop. Maintaining human capabilities in core areas is crucial as a safeguard against AI failures. While AI can augment expertise, the role of skilled professionals able to exercise discretion and oversight should not be discounted. With proper diligence, testing, and healthy skepticism, businesses can harness AI as a collaborator rather than a replacement for human judgment. The most prudent course is to balance algorithmic insights with human wisdom.

The key is to carefully validate AI systems, audit for biases, and continuously evaluate their performance after deployment. As long as the benefits and limitations are properly understood, AI can enhance decision-making. But an overreliance on algorithms without governance and human accountability invites risks that businesses should take care to avoid through mindful and responsible AI adoption strategies.

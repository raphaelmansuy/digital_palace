# Model Context Protocol (MCP) â€” Concise Guide

**MCP** is a universal protocol for AI apps to connect to tools and data sources, like USB-C for devices. It replaces rigid, custom API integrations with dynamic, standardized capability discovery.

## Why MCP?

- **Solves API rigidity:** No more breaking changes when APIs evolve; clients adapt automatically.
- **Reduces integration effort:** One protocol for all tools, not dozens of custom connectors.
- **Enables composable AI:** Apps, tools, and data become plug-and-play.

## How MCP Works

- **Client-server architecture:**
  - **Host:** AI app (e.g., Claude, Cursor)
  - **Client:** Manages connections, negotiates capabilities
  - **Server:** Exposes tools, data, prompts
- **Dynamic capability exchange:** Client queries server for available actions/resources; adapts to changes instantly.

## Key Benefits

- Automatic capability discovery
- Backward-compatible schema evolution
- Unified security, error handling, and debugging
- Scalable, future-proof AI integrations

## Example

- Weather API adds a new parameter: MCP clients adapt instantly, no code changes needed.

## üìñ Biography

Timnit Gebru is an Eritrean-Ethiopian computer scientist and AI ethics researcher who has become one of the most prominent voices advocating for responsible AI development. Born in Ethiopia and raised in the United States, she has dedicated her career to addressing algorithmic bias, fairness in machine learning, and the societal impact of AI systems.

Gebru gained international attention for her groundbreaking research on algorithmic bias in facial recognition systems and her advocacy for diversity in AI research. Her departure from Google in 2020, following disagreements over AI ethics research, sparked industry-wide discussions about corporate responsibility in AI development. She founded DAIR in 2021 to pursue independent AI research focused on communities most affected by AI systems.

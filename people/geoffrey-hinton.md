## 📖 Biography

Geoffrey Everest Hinton, often called the "Godfather of Deep Learning," is a British-Canadian cognitive psychologist and computer scientist. Born in 1947, he has been instrumental in the development of neural networks and deep learning. His work on backpropagation, Boltzmann machines, and deep belief networks laid the foundation for modern AI.

Hinton spent decades working on neural networks when they were unfashionable, persisting through the "AI winters." His breakthrough came with the AlexNet convolutional neural network in 2012, which revolutionized computer vision and sparked the deep learning renaissance.

## 🏆 Key Contributions

- Co-developed the backpropagation algorithm for neural networks
- Pioneered Boltzmann machines and deep belief networks
- Co-created AlexNet, launching the deep learning era
- Proposed capsule networks for spatial reasoning
- Co-invented dropout regularization

## 💬 Notable Quotes

> "I have always been convinced that the only way to get artificial intelligence to work is to do the computation in a way similar to the human brain."
> "The brain has about 10^14 synapses and we only live for about 10^9 seconds. So we have a lot more parameters than data. This motivates the idea that we must do a lot of unsupervised learning since the perceptual input is vastly greater than the number of bits of information in the supervised target output."
> "My view is throw it all away and start again. I don't think it's going to work, and I think we have to go back to the drawing board."

## 🎯 Current Role

- **Position**: CEO & Founder
- **Organization**: HumanLayer (Y Combinator F24)
- **Location**: San Francisco, CA
- **Previous**: 7 years at Replicated (Engineer → Product → Executive)

## 📖 Biography

Dex Horthy is the CEO and Founder of HumanLayer, a Y Combinator Fall 2024 startup that provides human-in-the-loop infrastructure for AI agents. Born around 1995, Dex began his coding journey at age 17 while working at NASA JPL, demonstrating an early passion for technology and space exploration.

He graduated from the University of Chicago and spent seven transformative years at Replicated, a Series C developer tools startup. During his tenure, he evolved from engineer to product manager to executive, working on container orchestrators and helping enterprise teams like HashiCorp, DataStax, and H2O.ai deliver Kubernetes-native versions of their self-hosted products. He founded and led the Go-To-Market organization at Replicated, gaining deep experience in developer-focused products.

The idea for HumanLayer emerged from his own experience building autonomous AI agents that managed SQL warehouses in Slack. When he realized that the most useful functions for AI agents are also the most risky, he developed human approval systems to enable safe deployment of high-impact AI automation. This led to founding HumanLayer in 2023, which now helps companies build AI agents that can perform meaningful work while maintaining human oversight and control.

## 💡 Notable Quotes

> "The most useful functions we can give to any software are also the most risky. This is especially true for non-deterministic systems driven by LLMs."

> "Even with state-of-the-art agentic reasoning and prompt routing, LLMs are not sufficiently reliable to be given access to high-stakes functions without human oversight."

> "The future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is 'outer loop' or 'headless' agents."

## 🌟 Special Sections

### 🏢 HumanLayer Vision

Dex envisions a future of "Generation 3" AI applications - Autonomous Agents that operate in the "outer loop," where agent-initiated communication replaces human-initiated interactions. HumanLayer serves as critical infrastructure for this transition, providing the approval and oversight mechanisms necessary to deploy AI agents safely in high-stakes environments.

The company addresses the $4.6 trillion global labor market that AI agents are poised to disrupt, but recognizes that reliable human oversight is essential for both current safety and future training of fully autonomous systems.

### 🔬 AI Agent Philosophy

Dex advocates for a pragmatic approach to AI agent development that prioritizes incremental confidence building over perfect automation. His "12-Factor Agents" framework emphasizes:

- Human oversight for high-stakes operations
- Incremental deployment with approval workflows
- Production testing with safety guarantees
- Observable and auditable agent behavior

### 🌍 Community Impact

Through AI Tinkerers San Francisco, Dex has built a community of AI practitioners exploring practical applications of agent technology. His work bridges the gap between academic AI research and real-world deployment challenges, providing both technical solutions and thought leadership for the AI engineering community.

## üéØ Current Role

- **Position**: CEO & Founder
- **Organization**: HumanLayer (Y Combinator F24)
- **Location**: San Francisco, CA
- **Previous**: 7 years at Replicated (Engineer ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Executive)

## üìñ Biography

Dex Horthy is the CEO and Founder of HumanLayer, a Y Combinator Fall 2024 startup that provides human-in-the-loop infrastructure for AI agents. Born around 1995, Dex began his coding journey at age 17 while working at NASA JPL, demonstrating an early passion for technology and space exploration.

He graduated from the University of Chicago and spent seven transformative years at Replicated, a Series C developer tools startup. During his tenure, he evolved from engineer to product manager to executive, working on container orchestrators and helping enterprise teams like HashiCorp, DataStax, and H2O.ai deliver Kubernetes-native versions of their self-hosted products. He founded and led the Go-To-Market organization at Replicated, gaining deep experience in developer-focused products.

The idea for HumanLayer emerged from his own experience building autonomous AI agents that managed SQL warehouses in Slack. When he realized that the most useful functions for AI agents are also the most risky, he developed human approval systems to enable safe deployment of high-impact AI automation. This led to founding HumanLayer in 2023, which now helps companies build AI agents that can perform meaningful work while maintaining human oversight and control.

## üèÜ Key Contributions

- **HumanLayer Platform**: Built the leading human-in-the-loop API for AI agents, enabling safe deployment of autonomous systems with approval workflows and oversight mechanisms
- **12-Factor Agents Methodology**: Developed and articulated comprehensive principles for building reliable, production-ready AI applications based on 12-factor app methodology adapted for LLM agents:
  - **Codebase**: One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
  - **Dependencies**: Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies (models, tools, data sources)
  - **Config**: Store config (API keys, model parameters) in the environment
  - **Backing Services**: Treat backing services (databases, APIs, model endpoints) as attached resources
  - **Build/Release/Run**: Strictly separate build, release, and run stages for agent deployments
  - **Processes**: Execute agents as stateless processes with externalized state
  - **Port Binding**: Export services (agent APIs) via port binding for horizontal scaling
  - **Concurrency**: Scale out via the process model (multiple agent instances)
  - **Disposability**: Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
  - **Dev/Prod Parity**: Keep development, staging, and production environments as similar as possible
  - **Logs**: Treat logs as event streams for comprehensive agent observability
  - **Admin Processes**: Run admin/management tasks (training, evaluation) as one-off processes
- **AI Agent Safety**: Pioneered practical approaches to AI agent oversight, approval workflows, and human-in-the-loop patterns for production systems
- **Agent Deployment Patterns**: Established best practices for stateless agent design, pause/resume workflows, and production deployment strategies
- **Developer Experience**: Led GTM organization at Replicated, improving developer experience for enterprise Kubernetes deployments
- **Container Orchestration**: Contributed to container orchestrator technology at Replicated, bringing DevOps principles to agent deployment
- **AI Tinkerers Community**: Organizes and runs AI Tinkerers meetups in San Francisco, fostering practical AI development practices

## üí° Notable Quotes

> "The most useful functions we can give to any software are also the most risky. This is especially true for non-deterministic systems driven by LLMs."

> "Even with state-of-the-art agentic reasoning and prompt routing, LLMs are not sufficiently reliable to be given access to high-stakes functions without human oversight."

> "The future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is 'outer loop' or 'headless' agents."

> "12-factor methodology provides a tried-and-true foundation for building reliable software. Adapting these principles for LLM applications ensures our agents can scale, deploy reliably, and operate in production environments."

> "Stateless agents that externalize all state to backing services can scale horizontally, recover from failures gracefully, and maintain consistency across distributed deployments."

> "The key to production AI agents is treating them like any other production software - with proper observability, deployment practices, and operational discipline."

## üåü Special Sections

### üè¢ HumanLayer Vision

Dex envisions a future of "Generation 3" AI applications - Autonomous Agents that operate in the "outer loop," where agent-initiated communication replaces human-initiated interactions. HumanLayer serves as critical infrastructure for this transition, providing the approval and oversight mechanisms necessary to deploy AI agents safely in high-stakes environments.

The company addresses the $4.6 trillion global labor market that AI agents are poised to disrupt, but recognizes that reliable human oversight is essential for both current safety and future training of fully autonomous systems.

### üî¨ AI Agent Philosophy

Dex advocates for a pragmatic approach to AI agent development that prioritizes incremental confidence building over perfect automation. His "12-Factor Agents" framework emphasizes:

- Human oversight for high-stakes operations
- Incremental deployment with approval workflows
- Production testing with safety guarantees
- Observable and auditable agent behavior

### üåç Community Impact

Through AI Tinkerers San Francisco, Dex has built a community of AI practitioners exploring practical applications of agent technology. His work bridges the gap between academic AI research and real-world deployment challenges, providing both technical solutions and thought leadership for the AI engineering community.

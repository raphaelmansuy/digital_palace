## 💬 Notable Quotes

> "The most useful functions we can give to any software are also the most risky. This is especially true for non-deterministic systems driven by LLMs."
> "Even with state-of-the-art agentic reasoning and prompt routing, LLMs are not sufficiently reliable to be given access to high-stakes functions without human oversight."
> "The future of AI Applications is not gonna be humans sitting at a chat interface, the future is 'outer loop' or 'headless' agents."
> "12-factor methodology provides a tried-and-true foundation for building reliable software. Adapting these principles for LLM applications ensures our agents can scale, deploy reliably, and operate in production environments."
> "Stateless agents that externalize all state to backing services can scale horizontally, recover from failures gracefully, and maintain consistency across distributed deployments."
> "The key to production AI agents is treating them like any other production software - with proper observability, deployment practices, and operational discipline."

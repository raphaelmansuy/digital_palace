## Principles for Clarity and Directness

1. **No need to be polite with LLM**
   > Example: "Analyze this data set and provide key insights."
   Why: LLMs don't have feelings. Direct prompts save tokens and reduce ambiguity.

2. **Use affirmative directives**
   > Example: "Do include specific examples in your explanation."
   Why: Positive instructions are clearer and more likely to be followed than negative ones.

3. **Incorporate phrases like "Your task is" and "You MUST"**
   > Example: "Your task is to summarize this article. You MUST include the main argument and three supporting points."
   Why: Emphasizes the importance and mandatory nature of the instructions.

4. **Use phrases like "You will be penalized"**
   > Example: "You will be penalized for using informal language in this business letter draft."
   Why: Creates a sense of consequence for not following instructions accurately.

5. **Use leading words like "think step by step"**
   > Example: "Solve this algebra problem. Think step by step."
   Why: Prompts the LLM to break down its reasoning process more explicitly.

6. **Clearly state requirements**
   > Example: "Create a marketing slogan for a new eco-friendly water bottle. Requirements: Must be under 10 words, include the product name 'AquaGreen', and appeal to environmentally conscious consumers."
   Why: Ensures the LLM understands all constraints and expectations for the output.

## Principles for Tailoring Content

7. **Integrate the intended audience**
   > Example: "Explain quantum entanglement to a high school physics student."
   Why: Helps the LLM tailor its language and content to the appropriate level.

8. **Ensure unbiased responses**
   > Example: "Describe the pros and cons of nuclear energy without favoring any particular viewpoint."
   Why: Helps counteract potential biases in the LLM's training data.

9. **Use "Answer in a natural, human-like manner"**
   > Example: "Describe your favorite book in a natural, human-like manner."
   Why: Encourages more conversational and less robotic-sounding responses.

10. **Assign a role to the language model**
    > Example: "You are a financial advisor. Explain the concept of compound interest to a young adult who's just started their first job."
    Why: Helps frame the LLM's perspective and knowledge base for the task.

## Principles for Structuring Prompts

11. **Break down complex tasks**
    > Example: "To write a research paper: 1. Develop a thesis. 2. Outline main points. 3. Write introduction. 4. Expand on each point. 5. Conclude."
    Why: Makes it easier for the LLM to process and respond to each part accurately.

12. **Implement example-driven prompting (few-shot)**
    > Example: "Translate English to French: 1. Hello -> Bonjour 2. Goodbye -> Au revoir 3. Thank you -> ?"
    Why: Provides concrete examples of desired output format and style.

13. **Use formatting with ###Instruction###, ###Example###, ###Question###**
    > Example:
    > "###Instruction###
    > Translate the following English phrase to Spanish.
    > ###Example###
    > English: How are you?
    > Spanish: ¿Cómo estás?
    > ###Question###
    > English: Where is the library?"
    Why: Clearly separates different parts of the prompt for better organization.

14. **Use delimiters**
    > Example: "Translate the following text to German: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
    Why: Clearly separates different parts of the input for easier processing.

15. **Combine Chain-of-thought with few-shot prompts**
    > Example: "Solve these math problems:
    > 1. 12 + 7 = 19 (12 plus 7 equals 19)
    > 2. 8 x 3 = 24 (8 multiplied by 3 equals 24)
    > 3. 15 - 6 = ? (Start with 15, subtract 6...)"
    Why: Demonstrates both the desired output and the reasoning process to get there.

## Principles for Enhancing Output Quality

16. **Add "I'm going to tip $xxx for a better solution!"**
    > Example: "I'm going to tip $50 for a comprehensive, step-by-step solution to this calculus problem!"
    Why: Creates a sense of importance and encourages more detailed responses.

17. **Allow the model to ask questions**
    > Example: "I want to learn about climate change. Ask me questions to determine what specific aspects I'm interested in."
    Why: Enables the LLM to gather more information for better-informed responses.

18. **To write detailed text**
    > Example: "Write a detailed paragraph about the process of photosynthesis, including all necessary scientific terms and explanations."
    Why: Explicitly requests comprehensive information on a topic.

19. **To inquire and test understanding**
    > Example: "Teach me about the American Civil War and include a short quiz at the end to test my understanding."
    Why: Encourages the LLM to both teach and assess comprehension.

20. **Repeat specific words or phrases**
    > Example: "Important: This information is crucial. Important: Pay close attention to the following details."
    Why: Emphasizes key points and ensures they're not overlooked.

## Principles for Specific Tasks

21. **Use output primers**
    > Example: "Write a story that begins with: 'The old clock struck midnight as the door slowly creaked open...'"
    Why: Guides the LLM towards a specific type or style of response.

22. **To write detailed essays/texts**
    > Example: "Write a detailed essay on the causes and effects of the Industrial Revolution, covering economic, social, and technological aspects."
    Why: Explicitly requests comprehensive, well-structured written content.

23. **To correct/change text without changing style**
    > Example: "Improve the grammar and clarity of this paragraph while maintaining its casual tone: 'So like, I went to the store yesterday and it was crazy busy cuz everyone was buying stuff for the holiday.'"
    Why: Maintains the original voice while improving specific aspects.

24. **For complex coding prompts**
    > Example: "Create a Python script that includes separate modules for user input, data processing, and output display. Include comments explaining each function."
    Why: Ensures all necessary components are included in multi-file coding tasks.

25. **To initiate or continue specific text**
    > Example: "Continue this poem in the same style:
    > 'Roses are red,
    > Violets are blue,'"
    Why: Provides a starting point or context for the LLM to build upon.

26. **To write text similar to a sample**
    > Example: "Write a product description for a smartwatch in the same style as this example for a smartphone: 'Sleek, powerful, and intuitive, the XPhone redefines mobile communication with its cutting-edge features and stunning design.'"
    Why: Provides a clear example of the desired style and format for the LLM to emulate.

## Technique 1: Assigning Roles and Responsibilities

### Example

```text
You are an expert content moderator responsible for identifying harmful aspects in user prompts. Carefully review the following prompt: {...}
```

### Explanation 
Assigning the model a specific role and responsibility provides context that steers its responses in terms of content, tone, style, etc. It encourages the model to embody that perspective.

### How-To
1. Decide on a relevant role or responsibility for the task
2. Clearly state this at the beginning of the prompt 
3. Optionally, emphasize key aspects like "You are an expert in..." or "You are responsible for..."
4. Provide the input for the model to process based on that role

### When to Use It
- When a specific tone, style or domain expertise is needed
- To improve output quality on tasks like content moderation, fact-checking, analysis, etc.
### Real-World Case Studies
- A customer service chatbot was improved by assigning it the role of an empathetic, problem-solving agent, resulting in higher customer satisfaction scores.
- An AI writing assistant was given the role of an experienced editor, providing more constructive and actionable feedback to users

## Technique 2: Structured Input and Output

### Example

```text
Extract the <name>, <size>, <price> and <color> attributes from this product description: 
<description>
The SmartHome Mini is a compact smart home assistant available in black or white for only $49.99...
</description>
```

### Explanation
Structured input helps the model better understand the task and input data. Structured output makes the model's responses easier to programmatically parse and integrate into downstream systems. 

### How-To
1. Identify the input data and desired output fields 
2. Represent the input data with semantic tags like XML or JSON
3. Specify the output fields and format in the instructions
4. Parse the model's structured output response downstream

### When to Use It
- When processing data like product info, user reviews, knowledge base entries, etc.
- To simplify integration of model outputs into databases, APIs, UIs

### Real-World Case Studies  
- An e-commerce company used structured product data to train an AI model to generate compelling product descriptions, increasing click-through rates and sales.
- A legal firm leveraged structured case briefs to build an AI-powered legal research assistant, saving attorneys hours of document review time.

## Technique 3: Prefilling Model Responses

### Example

```text
Extract the <name>, <size>, <price> and <color>. Respond using <response> tags:
<response>
<name>
```

### Explanation 
Prefilling the beginning of the model's response guarantees it will start with the provided text. This is useful for prompting a specific output format and simplifying parsing.

### How-To
1. Decide on the desired starting text or format
2. Add it as the beginning of the "assistant" or model response 
3. Ensure it is phrased as a partial sentence the model can continue

### When to Use It
- To enforce a consistent output format 
- When the output needs to be parsed or deserialized in a certain way

### Real-World Case Studies
- A mental health app prefilled its AI therapist's responses with empathetic phrases, creating a more supportive and engaging user experience.
- A sales automation tool prefilled email templates with personalized greetings and calls-to-action, improving response rates and conversions.

## Technique 4: N-Shot Prompting

### Example

```text
"Classify the sentiment of this movie review:
Review: The plot was gripping and the acting superb. I was on the edge of my seat!
Sentiment: Positive

Review: The story made no sense and the characters were totally unbelievable. A waste of time.
Sentiment: Negative 

Review: It started off intriguing but fell flat. Some good moments but overall disappointing.
Sentiment: Mixed

Review: {New Review}
Sentiment:"
```

### Explanation
Providing multiple input-output examples demonstrates to the model how to perform the task and the desired response format. This conditions the model to follow the same pattern.

### How-To
1. Collect a diverse set of examples that represent expected production inputs
2. Ensure examples capture key formats, edge cases, etc.
3. Provide at least a dozen examples, more for complex tasks
4. Place examples before the actual input to be processed

### When to Use It
- For most tasks, as it improves output quality and consistency
- When a specific response format or style needs to be followed

### Real-World Case Studies
- A news aggregator used n-shot prompting to train its AI to categorize articles by topic, improving recommendation accuracy and user engagement.  
- An HR tech startup applied n-shot prompting to build an AI resume screener, enabling faster and more consistent candidate filtering.


## Technique 5: Chain-of-Thought Prompting

### Example

```text
"Here is a meeting transcript:
<transcript>
{Transcript Text} 
</transcript>

Think through how to summarize this:
<sketchpad>
- Identify key decisions made and who is responsible for them 
- Note important discussion points and takeaways
- Determine overall objective and outcome of the meeting
</sketchpad>

Based on the <sketchpad>, provide a summary of the meeting:
<summary>"
```

### Explanation
Chain-of-thought prompting encourages the model to break down its reasoning into intermediate steps before providing a final result. This often improves output quality, especially on complex tasks.

### How-To
1. Specify the input and task
2. Provide a "sketchpad" or "scratchpad" for the model to show its work
3. Optionally include detailed instructions for the reasoning process
4. Ask the model to generate a final output based on the intermediate steps

### When to Use It
- For tasks involving multiple steps, reasoning, or calculations
- To improve transparency and interpretability of model outputs
- When output factuality and faithfulness to the input is critical

### Real-World Case Studies
- An educational app used CoT prompting to create an AI tutor that could walk students through complex problem-solving steps, enhancing learning outcomes.
- A financial analysis firm leveraged CoT prompting to build an AI investment advisor that could explain its stock picks, increasing client trust and retention.

## Technique 6: Splitting Prompts into Smaller Steps

### Example

```text
First, extract all the names mentioned:
<names>
{Names Extracted}
</names>

Next, extract key events and their dates: 
<events>
{Events Extracted}
</events>

Finally, summarize the relationships between the extracted names and events:
<summary>
{Final Summary}
</summary>
```


### Explanation
Decomposing a complex prompt into a series of smaller, focused prompts can improve the quality of the final output. It allows the model to concentrate on one task at a time.

### How-To
1. Identify the sub-tasks required to generate the final output
2. Write focused prompts for each sub-task 
3. Prompt the model step-by-step, using previous outputs as inputs to the next step
4. Combine the results into a final output

### When to Use It
- For complex tasks that require multiple processing steps
- When a large input needs to be broken down and analyzed piece-by-piece
- To reduce hallucination by grounding each step in previous model outputs
### Real-World Case Studies  
- A marketing agency split its content generation prompts into ideation, outlining, and writing steps, producing higher-quality blog posts and social media content.
- A software development team decomposed its code generation prompts into function definition, docstring, and implementation steps, leading to more modular and maintainable code.

## Technique 7: Optimal Context Placement

### Example

```text
You are an expert meeting assistant responsible for writing accurate meeting minutes. 

<transcript>
{Meeting Transcript}
</transcript>

Identify the key decisions, discussion points, and next steps. Summarize everything concisely.

<minutes>
```

### Explanation
For best results, provide the input context near the beginning of the prompt, after specifying the model's role but before giving detailed instructions. This focuses the model on the input.

### How-To
1. Specify the model's role or responsibilities first
2. Provide the input context or information to be processed 
3. Give detailed instructions on what to do with the context
4. Optionally specify an output format

### When to Use It
- In most prompts, as this sequence tends to work well
- Especially for tasks where the input context is critical 

### Real-World Case Studies
- An AI-powered virtual event platform optimized its prompts by frontloading key event details, resulting in more relevant and engaging session recommendations for attendees.
- A travel booking site improved its chatbot's responses by placing trip preferences and constraints early in the prompt, providing more personalized and efficient customer support.

## Technique 8: Crafting Effective Instructions

### Example
```text
"Summarize the key points from the transcript below.

Use short, concise sentences.

Organize the summary into 'Decisions', 'Action Items' and 'Other Notes' sections.

<transcript>
{Transcript}
</transcript>

<summary>"
```


### Explanation
Effective instructions are critical for getting good results from LLMs. The instructions should be clear, specific, and formatted for easy reading by the model.

### How-To
1. Use short, focused sentences 
2. Separate instructions with newlines
3. Bold or emphasize key parts if supported by the model
4. Avoid very low-level or overly obvious instructions
5. Periodically review and refactor prompts to keep them concise

### When to Use It
- Always! Investing in writing good instructions pays off in better model outputs.

### Real-World Case Studies
- A UX research firm refined its prompts with clearer, more specific instructions, eliciting more insightful and actionable user feedback.
- A non-profit organization optimized its grant proposal generation prompts, securing more funding by aligning outputs with funder priorities and guidelines.
## Technique 9: Mitigating Hallucinations

### Example
```text
"Based on the information provided in <context>, answer the question. If there is not enough information to answer conclusively, respond with 'I don't know.'

<context>
{Context}
</context>

Question: {Question}

Answer:"
```

### Explanation
Models can sometimes "hallucinate" or fabricate information not present in the input. We can reduce this by instructing the model to express uncertainty when appropriate.

### How-To
1. Remind the model to answer based only on the provided context
2. Instruct it to say "I don't know" or similar if the input does not contain enough information 
3. Ask the model to express its confidence and only answer if highly confident
4. Use chain-of-thought prompting to enable the model to check its work

### When to Use It
- For question-answering or knowledge-retrieval tasks
- When factual accuracy is critical and hallucination must be minimized
- In combination with other techniques like CoT prompting

### Real-World Case Studies
- A medical diagnosis AI reduced false positives by instructing the model to only make confident predictions based on clear symptom evidence, enhancing patient safety.
- A fake news detection system mitigated false alarms by prompting the model to focus on verifiable claims and credible sources, improving its reliability and trust.
## Technique 10: Using Stop Sequences 

### Example
```text
"Summarize the following meeting transcript:

<transcript> 
{transcript}
</transcript>

Provide a concise summary:
<summary>"

Stop Sequences: ["</summary>"]
```

### Explanation
Stop sequences are words or phrases that signal the model to stop generating further content. They help avoid trailing text and make responses easier to parse.

### How-To
1. Identify a unique stop word or phrase 
2. Include it at the end of your prompt's expected output
3. Provide the stop sequence as a parameter when calling the model API
4. Parse the model's output up until the stop sequence 

### When to Use It
- To get cleaner, more predictable model outputs
- When the response needs to be programmatically parsed
- To avoid paying for unnecessary generated tokens

## Technique 11: Selecting an Optimal Temperature

### Example

```text
Temperature = 0.2 # For precise, focused outputs
Temperature = 0.8 # For more diverse, creative outputs
```

### Explanation 
Temperature is a model parameter that controls the "creativity" of outputs. Lower values produce more focused, deterministic responses while higher values give more diverse, unpredictable results.

### How-To
1. Understand your task and desired output characteristics 
2. Start with a temperature of 0.8, then adjust as needed
3. Use lower temperatures (0.2-0.5) for precise, analytical, or multiple-choice tasks
4. Use higher temperatures (0.7-1.0) for open-ended, creative, or opinion-based tasks

### When to Use It
- Always set this parameter for your use case, don't just use the default
- Dial it up or down depending on the level of focus vs creativity needed

### Real-World Case Studies
- An AI-powered recipe generator found the sweet spot between creativity and coherence by fine-tuning its temperature, producing more diverse yet reliable meal ideas and instructions.
- A fashion startup optimized its outfit recommendation model's temperature to strike a balance between novelty and wearability, increasing user satisfaction and engagement.


## Technique 12: Prompt Chaining

### Example

```text
Generate three creative story ideas based on the theme 'unexpected friendship':
<ideas>
1. {Idea 1}
2. {Idea 2} 
3. {Idea 3}
</ideas>
```

```text
Select the most original idea and expand it into a short plot summary:
<plot>
{Plot summary}
</plot>
```


```text
Polish the writing and add vivid details to create an engaging story opening:  
<story>
{Opening paragraphs}
</story>
```

### Explanation
Prompt chaining involves using the output of one prompt as the input to a subsequent prompt. This allows guiding the model through a multi-step generative process to iteratively refine and improve the output.

### How-To
1. Break down your task into a series of prompts, with each building on the previous one
2. Specify the input and output format for each step
3. Use the model's output from one step as the input to the next
4. Repeat until you reach a satisfactory final output

### When to Use It
- For complex generative tasks that can be decomposed into steps
- To allow the model to iteratively refine and improve its output
- When a single prompt would be too complicated or constraining

### Real-World Case Studies
- A gaming studio used prompt chaining to generate rich, multi-step character backstories, quests, and dialogues, creating more immersive and engaging RPG experiences.
- An advertising agency leveraged prompt chaining to ideate, refine, and visualize ad concepts, producing more creative and impactful campaigns in less time.

## Technique 13: Prompt Tuning

### Example
```prompt
Tune a prompt to reproduce the following behavior:

User: How do I bake chocolate chip cookies from scratch?
Assistant: Here's a simple recipe for delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies:

Ingredients:
- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt 
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 large eggs
- 2 cups semisweet chocolate chips

Instructions:
1. Preheat the oven to 375°F and line baking sheets with parchment paper.
2. In a bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside.
3. In a large bowl or a stand mixer, beat the butter and both sugars until creamy. 
4. Beat in the vanilla and eggs until combined.
5. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the wet ingredients. 
6. Stir in the chocolate chips by hand.
7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the lined baking sheets.
8. Bake for 9 to 11 minutes or until golden brown. 
9. Cool on the baking sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely.

Enjoy your warm, gooey homemade chocolate chip cookies with a cold glass of milk!

User: What's the best way to remove a red wine stain?
Assistant: To remove a red wine stain, follow these steps:

1. Blot the stain immediately with a clean cloth to absorb as much wine as possible. Avoid rubbing, as this can spread the stain.

2. Sprinkle salt liberally over the stain while it's still wet. The salt will absorb the wine and help lift the color. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes, then brush off the salt.

3. Stretch the fabric over a bowl and secure with a rubber band. Pour boiling water over the stain from about 8 inches above - the height gives force to flush out the stain.

4. If the stain persists, mix 1 part dish soap and 2 parts hydrogen peroxide. Test on an inconspicuous area first. Apply to the stain and let sit for 30 minutes. Rinse thoroughly. 

5. For stubborn stains, soak the garment in an enzyme cleaner or color-safe bleach and cold water overnight. Then launder as usual.

6. If the garment is dry clean only, blot the stain and take it to the dry cleaner as soon as possible. Point out the stain and let them know it's red wine.

The key is to act quickly, use cold water (hot water can set the stain), and be patient in repeating treatments as needed. With these steps, you have a good chance of removing that pesky red wine stain.

User: {New User Input}
Assistant:"
```

### Explanation
Prompt tuning uses machine learning to optimize prompts based on a set of example conversations. By providing high-quality examples of desired behavior, you can "tune" a base prompt to reliably reproduce those behaviors in new conversations.

### How-To
1. Collect a set of example conversations demonstrating ideal model behavior
2. Format the conversations for tuning, typically as a series of user-assistant exchanges
3. Use a tool like [DSPY](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy) to tune a prompt on the examples
4. Test the tuned prompt on new inputs and gather more examples to iteratively refine it

### When to Use It
- When you have a large set of example conversations to learn from
- To discover optimized prompts faster than through manual iteration
- For use cases where highly reliable and consistent model behavior is critical

### Real-World Case Studies
- An e-learning platform tuned its prompts on learner interaction data to create more personalized and effective course content and assessments.
- A mental health startup fine-tuned its prompts on therapist-patient conversations to develop a more empathetic and supportive AI companion for its users.

### Detailed Explanation

Prompt ensembling is a technique that combines outputs from multiple prompts to produce a final response that incorporates the best aspects of each individual prompt's output. The idea is to leverage the strengths and mitigate the weaknesses of different prompting approaches by generating candidate responses from prompts with different tones, styles, focus areas, or perspectives, and then intelligently combining them.

There are a few key steps to prompt ensembling:

1. **Prompt Design**: Create multiple prompts that each capture a different desired aspect, tone, or style for the output. These prompts should be designed to complement each other and provide a diverse set of candidate responses. For example, you might have one prompt that focuses on a formal, professional tone, another that emphasizes an empathetic and understanding perspective, and a third that prioritizes conciseness and clarity.

2. **Candidate Generation**: Use each of these prompts separately to generate a candidate response from the language model. This will give you a set of responses with different characteristics based on the specific prompts used. 

3. **Response Combination**: Use an additional "ensembling" prompt to evaluate and combine the best elements from each of the candidate responses. This prompt should instruct the model on how to select the most relevant parts from each candidate and integrate them into a coherent final response. Alternatively, you can use different sampling methods, temperatures, or other generation parameters for each prompt and then combine the outputs stochastically or via a weighted average.

The key benefit of prompt ensembling is that it allows you to inject multiple desired characteristics into the model's output that may be difficult to achieve with a single prompt. By generating responses from different angles and then combining them, the final output can be more nuanced, comprehensive, and well-rounded.

### Detailed Example

Let's walk through a concrete example of using prompt ensembling to generate a response to a customer email complaint. We'll use three different prompts to capture different aspects of an ideal response.

```text
Customer Email:
"I am extremely frustrated with your service. I have been trying to get a refund for the defective product I received for weeks now, but every time I call customer support, I get the runaround. This is unacceptable. If I don't get my refund processed within the next 48 hours, I will be taking my business elsewhere and filing a complaint with the Better Business Bureau."
```

Prompt 1 - Empathetic Tone: 
```text
Write a response to this customer complaint email that is highly empathetic and understanding of their frustration:
<empathetic_response>
Dear valued customer,
I am deeply sorry to hear about the difficulties you have experienced with our service and the frustration this has caused you. I want to assure you that we take your concerns extremely seriously and are committed to making this right.
I can only imagine how exasperating it must be to have to deal with a defective product and then face challenges getting a refund processed in a timely manner. This is not the level of service we strive to provide, and I sincerely apologize for falling short in this instance. 
Please know that I will be escalating this issue to our customer support management team to ensure your refund is expedited and that you receive the care and attention you deserve. You can expect to receive your refund within the next 48 hours.
We truly value your business and are grateful for the opportunity to serve you. If there is anything else I can assist with, please don't hesitate to reach out. We are here to help.
With deepest apologies,
[Your Name]
Customer Service Representative
</empathetic_response>
```

Prompt 2 - Solution-Oriented:
```text
Write a response to this customer complaint email that is focused on providing a clear solution and concrete next steps:
<solution_response>
Dear [Customer Name],
Thank you for bringing this issue to our attention. I apologize for the unacceptable delay in processing your refund for the defective product you received. 
Here are the steps we will take to resolve this immediately:
1. I have escalated your case to our customer support management team with a high priority status. They will be reviewing your case and ensuring your refund is processed as quickly as possible.
2. You can expect to receive your full refund within the next 48 hours. We will send you a confirmation email once the refund has been issued.
3. As a token of our apology for the inconvenience caused, we would like to offer you a 20% discount on your next purchase with us. The discount code will be included in your refund confirmation email.
4. If you experience any further issues or have additional concerns, please respond to this email and I will personally ensure your needs are met.
We are fully committed to your satisfaction and sincerely apologize for the frustration this experience has caused you. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to make this right.
Best regards,
[Your Name]  
Customer Service Representative
</solution_response>
```

Prompt 3 - Combine Empathetic and Solution-Oriented:
```text
Combine the most relevant parts of the <empathetic_response> and <solution_response> to create a final customer response that is both understanding and provides clear next steps. Ensure the tone remains consistent and the response flows well.
<final_response>
Dear [Customer Name],
I am deeply sorry to hear about the frustration and inconvenience you have experienced due to the delay in processing your refund for the defective product you received. I want to assure you that we take your concerns very seriously and are committed to resolving this issue to your full satisfaction.
Here are the immediate steps we will be taking:
1. I have escalated your case to our customer support management team with high priority. They will ensure your refund is processed within the next 48 hours. You will receive a confirmation email once the refund has been issued.
2. As a token of our sincere apology, we will be including a 20% discount code for your next purchase in the refund confirmation email.
3. If you have any further concerns or issues, please respond directly to this email and I will personally ensure your needs are met promptly.
We deeply value your business and the trust you place in us. I am truly sorry we have fallen short of our commitment to providing exceptional service in this instance. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to correct this and provide you with the care and attention you deserve.
With deepest apologies and appreciation,
[Your Name]
Customer Service Representative
</final_response>
```

In this example, the first prompt focused on expressing empathy and understanding for the customer's frustration, while the second prompt emphasized providing a clear solution and concrete next steps. The third prompt then combined the most relevant parts of each to create a final response that was both empathetic and solution-oriented.

By using prompt ensembling, we were able to generate a customer response that was more comprehensive and nuanced than what a single prompt could likely achieve. The final response acknowledges the customer's frustration, takes responsibility for the service failure, provides a clear timeline and steps for resolving the issue, and offers a token of apology, all while maintaining a consistent, caring tone.

### When to Use Prompt Ensembling

Prompt ensembling is particularly useful in situations where you want the model's output to exhibit multiple characteristics or cover different aspects that are hard to capture with a single prompt. Some specific use cases where prompt ensembling can be beneficial include:

- **Customer Service**: As demonstrated in the example above, ensembling can help generate responses that are empathetic, solution-focused, and strike the right tone for the situation.

- **Content Creation**: For generating blog posts, articles, or marketing copy, you can ensemble prompts that focus on different aspects like storytelling, persuasion, SEO optimization, and brand voice to create more compelling and comprehensive content.

- **Persona Embodiment**: If you want the model to respond as a specific persona, you can ensemble prompts that capture different facets of that persona's background, knowledge, personality, and communication style.

- **Balanced Perspectives**: For topics that benefit from considering multiple viewpoints, ensembling prompts with different stances or angles can help produce a more balanced and well-rounded response.

- **Creative Writing**: Ensembling prompts tuned for different writing styles, tones, or genres can help generate more unique and engaging creative writing outputs.

The key is to identify the distinct aspects you want to inject into the model's output, create targeted prompts for each, and then combine them in a way that leverages their individual strengths.

### Tips for Effective Prompt Ensembling

To get the most out of prompt ensembling, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Complementary Prompts**: Design your individual prompts to be complementary rather than redundant. Each prompt should focus on a distinct aspect or characteristic that the others don't fully capture.

2. **Balanced Combination**: When combining the candidate responses, aim for a balance between the different aspects. Avoid over-emphasizing one prompt's output at the expense of the others.

3. **Coherence and Consistency**: Ensure that the final combined response maintains a coherent structure and consistent tone. The output should read as a unified whole rather than disjointed parts.

4. **Iteration and Testing**: Developing effective ensembles often requires iteration and testing. Experiment with different prompt combinations, generation parameters, and combination strategies to see what produces the best results for your specific use case.

5. **Quality Control**: While ensembling can help improve output quality, it's not a silver bullet. Make sure to review the final outputs for factual accuracy, coherence, and alignment with your desired tone and intent.

By thoughtfully designing and combining complementary prompts, prompt ensembling can be a powerful tool for generating nuanced, comprehensive, and high-quality model outputs. It allows you to leverage the strengths of different prompting approaches and mitigate their individual weaknesses. As with any prompt engineering technique, experimentation and iteration are key to finding the optimal ensemble for your specific use case.


### How-To  
1. Create multiple prompts that each capture a different desired aspect of the output
2. Generate a candidate response from each prompt
3. Use an additional prompt to evaluate and combine the best elements of the candidates
4. Alternatively, use different sampling methods or temperatures for each prompt and combine stochastically

### When to Use It
- To inject multiple tones, styles, or perspectives into model outputs
- When a single prompt tends to be overly narrow or one-dimensional 
- To improve output diversity and quality by leveraging the strengths of different prompts

### Real-World Case Studies
- A financial news summarization service ensembled prompts focused on different aspects like key events, numbers, and sentiment to produce more comprehensive and nuanced article summaries.
- A poetry writing app blended prompts tuned for different styles, moods, and imagery to help users generate more expressive and evocative works.

## Technique 15: Prompt Augmentation

### Example
```text
"Generate a company mission statement for an eco-friendly cleaning products brand. 

Company Background:
- Founded in 2010 in Portland, Oregon
- Specializes in plant-based, biodegradable cleaning solutions
- Donates 1% of profits to ocean conservation charities  
- Has a carbon-neutral supply chain and uses recycled packaging
- Certified B-Corp and 1% for the Planet member

Mission Statement:
<mission>
{Generated mission statement}
</mission>
```


### Explanation
Prompt augmentation involves injecting relevant information or context into the prompt itself, rather than just relying on the model's inherent knowledge. By providing key facts about the subject, you can help the model produce a more informed, customized output that aligns with the specific use case.

### How-To
1. Identify the most salient information for the task, such as key facts, requirements, or context
2. Organize this background info into a clear, concise format 
3. Incorporate the additional context into the prompt, before the actual instruction
4. Adjust the info as needed based on the model's outputs

### When to Use It

### Explanation

Prompt decomposition is a technique that involves breaking down a complex task prompt into multiple smaller, more focused sub-prompts. Instead of trying to tackle a multifaceted problem with a single overarching prompt, you create targeted prompts for each key aspect or component of the input. This allows the model to analyze each piece more thoroughly and produce a more comprehensive and nuanced final output.

The process of prompt decomposition typically involves these steps:

1. **Task Analysis**: Start by carefully analyzing the overarching task and identifying the key components, aspects, or dimensions that need to be addressed. These will form the basis for your sub-prompts.

2. **Sub-Prompt Creation**: For each identified component, create a specific sub-prompt that focuses solely on that aspect. The sub-prompt should provide clear instructions on what to analyze and how to format the output.

3. **Focused Analysis**: Use each sub-prompt separately to generate a focused analysis from the model on that specific component. This allows the model to go in-depth on each aspect without getting overwhelmed or confused by the complexity of the full task.

4. **Synthesis Prompt**: After generating outputs for all the sub-prompts, create a final prompt that asks the model to synthesize the key insights from the previous analyses into a coherent overall output. This prompt should provide guidance on how to prioritize and integrate the information.

5. **Iteration and Refinement**: Review the final output to assess if it comprehensively addresses the original task. If there are gaps or weaknesses, iterate on your sub-prompts to cover those areas. You may need to add, remove, or modify sub-prompts based on what you observe.

The key benefit of prompt decomposition is that it allows the model to focus its attention and capacity on one aspect at a time, rather than trying to juggle everything at once. By guiding the model through a series of targeted analyses, you can get a more thorough and multidimensional final output that covers all the important bases.

### Detailed Example

Let's walk through an example of using prompt decomposition to analyze a company's financial health based on its annual report. The overarching task is to assess the company's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT analysis).

```text
Annual Report Excerpt:
"In fiscal year 2022, Acme Inc. achieved record revenue of $500 million, a 20% increase from the previous year. This growth was driven primarily by strong performance in our cloud software division, which saw a 35% increase in sales. Operating expenses increased by 15% to $350 million, largely due to investments in research and development for new product lines. Net income rose to $100 million, a 25% increase. 

However, the company also faced challenges in its hardware division, with sales declining 10% due to supply chain disruptions and increased competition. To address this, we have implemented a cost reduction plan and are exploring strategic partnerships.

Looking ahead, we see significant opportunities in the growing market for AI-powered business solutions, where our new products are well-positioned. However, we also face threats from the ongoing economic uncertainty and the risk of new entrants in our core markets."
```

Sub-Prompt 1 - Strengths:
```text
Identify the company's key strengths based on the annual report excerpt:
<strengths>
- Record revenue of $500 million, a 20% increase from the previous year
- Strong performance in the cloud software division, with a 35% increase in sales
- Net income rose to $100 million, a 25% increase
- Well-positioned in the growing market for AI-powered business solutions with new products
</strengths>
```

Sub-Prompt 2 - Weaknesses:
```text
Identify the company's main weaknesses based on the annual report excerpt:
<weaknesses>
- Hardware division sales declined 10% due to supply chain disruptions and increased competition
- Operating expenses increased by 15% to $350 million, cutting into profitability
</weaknesses>
```

Sub-Prompt 3 - Opportunities:
```text
Identify the key opportunities for the company based on the annual report excerpt:
<opportunities>
- Significant growth potential in the expanding market for AI-powered business solutions
- Leveraging new products in this space to capture market share and drive revenue growth
- Exploring strategic partnerships to bolster the struggling hardware division
</opportunities>
```

Sub-Prompt 4 - Threats:
```text
Identify the main threats facing the company based on the annual report excerpt:
<threats>
- Ongoing economic uncertainty could dampen demand and impact revenue growth
- Risk of new entrants in the company's core markets, increasing competition and pricing pressure
- Continued challenges in the hardware division, which may drag down overall performance
</threats>
```

Synthesis Prompt:
```text
Based on the <strengths>, <weaknesses>, <opportunities>, and <threats> identified, provide an overall assessment of the company's financial health and strategic position. Highlight the most important factors and provide recommendations for prioritization and action.

<synthesis>
Acme Inc.'s financial health is strong, with record revenue and net income growth driven by its thriving cloud software division. The company's well-positioned new products in the high-potential AI market present a significant opportunity for future expansion and market share gains.

However, Acme faces challenges in its hardware division, which is dragging down overall performance and profitability. Addressing this through cost reduction and strategic partnerships should be a key priority. The company must also navigate economic headwinds and the threat of new competitors in its core markets.

Overall, Acme is in a good position for growth if it can successfully execute on its AI opportunity while shoring up its hardware business. Key recommendations include:

1. Double down on AI product development and go-to-market to capture share in this fast-growing space
2. Accelerate efforts to cut costs and boost efficiency in the hardware division
3. Pursue strategic partnerships to gain scale and capabilities in hardware
4. Monitor economic conditions closely and be prepared to adjust plans if needed
5. Invest in marketing and differentiation to defend against new market entrants

By focusing on these priorities, Acme can build on its strengths, mitigate its risks, and position itself for sustainable growth and market leadership.
</synthesis>
```

In this example, we decomposed the complex task of a SWOT analysis into four targeted sub-prompts, each focusing on a specific aspect of the company's situation. This allowed the model to do a deep dive into each area and pull out the most relevant information.

The synthesis prompt then asked the model to integrate the key insights from the sub-prompts into an overall assessment and set of recommendations. By guiding the model through this structured analysis, we were able to get a comprehensive, nuanced output that covered all the important dimensions.

### When to Use Prompt Decomposition

Prompt decomposition is particularly useful for tasks that involve analyzing complex subject matter from multiple angles or generating lengthy outputs with distinct sections. Some specific use cases where prompt decomposition can be beneficial include:

- **Comprehensive Evaluations**: Breaking down the assessment of an essay, job application, product review, or other complex document into component scores or analyses for criteria like structure, content, style, etc.

- **Multi-Dimensional Strategy**: Decomposing a strategic planning exercise into separate prompts for goals, priorities, resources, risks, timeline, etc. to develop a more complete and coherent plan.

- **Detailed Feedback and Recommendations**: Providing in-depth feedback on a piece of writing, code, design, or other creative work by using targeted prompts for different aspects like clarity, originality, technical merit, and areas for improvement.

- **Thorough Q&A**: Answering a complex, multi-part question by breaking it down into sub-questions and synthesizing the partial answers into a complete, well-organized response.

- **Structured Reports or Presentations**: Generating a comprehensive report or presentation by using separate prompts for each section like executive summary, methodology, findings, conclusions, etc. and then integrating them.

The common thread is that prompt decomposition works well when you need the model to provide a thorough, multi-dimensional analysis or generate a lengthy, structured output. By breaking the task into smaller, focused parts, you can get a more complete and coherent final product.

### Tips for Effective Prompt Decomposition

To get the most out of prompt decomposition, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Make sure your sub-prompts cover all the key aspects of the task. Do a thorough analysis upfront to identify the important components and dimensions to include.

2. **Mutual Exclusivity**: Aim for sub-prompts that are as distinct and non-overlapping as possible. You want each one to elicit unique insights, not redundant information.

3. **Appropriate Granularity**: Strike a balance in the scope of your sub-prompts. Too narrow and you'll end up with an overwhelming number of them. Too broad and the model won't be able to provide sufficiently detailed analysis.

4. **Consistent Formatting**: Use a consistent format for your sub-prompts and their outputs. This will make it easier for the model to understand what's expected and for you to integrate the results.

5. **Synthesis Guidance**: Provide clear instructions in your synthesis prompt for how to prioritize, integrate, and format the final output. The more specific guidance you give, the better the model can pull everything together.

By thoughtfully designing your sub-prompts and synthesis prompt, you can leverage the power of prompt decomposition to get more comprehensive, nuanced, and well-structured model outputs. It's a valuable technique to have in your prompt engineering toolkit for tackling complex analysis and generation tasks.


### How-To
1. Identify the key components or aspects of the input to analyze
2. Create a focused sub-prompt for each component 
3. Provide clear instructions and formatting for each sub-prompt
4. Use a final sub-prompt to synthesize the results of the preceding ones
5. Adjust sub-prompts as needed to cover missing pieces or address weaknesses

### When to Use It
- For analyzing complex input from multiple angles or dimensions
- To get more structured and organized model output 
- When a single overarching prompt would be too open-ended or ambiguous

### Real-World Case Studies
- A contract analysis company broke down its document review prompts into separate queries for identifying parties, obligations, dates, and risks, enabling more thorough and accurate AI-assisted analysis.
- A social media management tool decomposed its content moderation prompts into distinct checks for hate speech, misinformation, spam, and explicit content, improving the precision and recall of its automated filters.

## Technique 17: Prompt-Based Fine-Tuning

### 
### Example
Fine-tune a model on a dataset formatted like:

```text
Q: Summarize the following article:
<article>
{Article text}
</article>

A: <summary>
{Article summary}
</summary>

Then at inference, prompt with:
Summarize the following article:
<article> 
{New article text}
</article>

<summary>
```


### Explanation
Rather than just providing prompts at inference time, you can integrate them into the model fine-tuning process itself. By formatting the training data in the same question-answer format as the target prompts, the model learns to follow those specific instructions and reproduce the desired prompted behavior more reliably.

### How-To
1. Collect a dataset of input-output pairs for your task
2. Format each example like a prompt, with the input as the "question" and output as the "answer"
3. Fine-tune the model on this prompt-formatted dataset
4. At inference time, prompt the model with new inputs in the same format as the training data
5. The model will be primed to follow the instructions and generate outputs in the expected format

### When to Use It
- When you have a large enough dataset to fine-tune on (few-shot learning is not enough)
- For tasks where you want the model to reliably follow a specific interaction pattern
- To "bake in" certain prompts or instructions into the model's behavior
- When you need faster inference than what few-shot prompting allows

### Real-World Case Studies
- A telehealth provider fine-tuned its diagnostic model on doctor-patient prompts across different specialties, demographics, and conditions, significantly improving its accuracy and breadth.
- An AI writing startup fine-tuned its model on successful author-editor prompt-response pairs to develop a more versatile and reliable co-writing assistant for its users.


## Troubleshooting Tips

As you start implementing these prompt engineering techniques, you may encounter some common challenges or pitfalls. Here are some tips to help troubleshoot issues and ensure you get the best possible results:

### Overly Verbose or Irrelevant Outputs
If the model's responses are overly wordy, off-topic, or include unnecessary information, try the following:
- Tighten up your instructions to be as specific and concise as possible. Avoid any ambiguity.
- Provide more focused examples that demonstrate staying on-topic and being succinct. 
- Use techniques like Structured Output to constrain the model to a specific format.
- Reduce the temperature parameter to make outputs more focused and less "creative."

### Factual Inaccuracies or Hallucinations
When the model makes incorrect statements or fabricates information not present in the input:
- Emphasize in your prompt to only use information from the provided context. 
- Instruct the model to express uncertainty when the input is insufficient to answer confidently.
- Use Chain-of-Thought Prompting to allow the model to show its work and check its own reasoning.
- Fine-tune the model on high-quality ground truth data to reduce its propensity for hallucination.

### Lack of Consistency Across Outputs
If you're getting highly variable quality or relevance of outputs across different prompts:
- Provide more and higher-quality examples in your Few-Shot prompts to establish a clearer pattern.
- Use Prompt Tuning on a larger dataset to optimize prompts for consistency.
- Increase the determinism of your sampling method or reduce the temperature.
- Ensemble multiple prompts and combine their outputs to average out the variability.

### Slow Generation Time
When the model is taking a long time to generate outputs, particularly with complex prompts:
- Look for ways to simplify or decompose your prompt into smaller sub-tasks.
- Reduce the maximum output length if you don't need long-form generation.
- Use a smaller model with fewer parameters for faster inference.
- Fine-tune the model on your specific task so it requires less prompt-time "learning."

### Difficulty Refining Prompts
If you're struggling to iteratively improve your prompts to get the desired results:
- Get inspiration from prompt galleries and examples that have worked well for similar tasks.
- Systematically isolate and test specific parts of your prompt to see which have the biggest impact.
- Gather a diverse set of input examples that cover different scenarios your prompt needs to handle.
- Collaborate with others and get feedback on your prompts - fresh eyes can spot new opportunities.

Remember, prompt engineering is an iterative process. Don't get discouraged if your initial attempts don't work perfectly. Analyze what's not working, form a hypothesis, and methodically test it. With persistence and experimentation, you'll be able to refine your prompts to consistently produce excellent outputs. Embrace the iteration and enjoy the process of becoming a prompt engineering pro!
